Every game of <em>Open Legend</em> revolves around intrepid characters performing heroic deeds. They will fight mythic beasts, break ancient curses, solve mind-boggling puzzles, discover untold treasures, and more.</p><p><em>Open Legend</em> was designed to let you tell big stories using small rules. It’s not that the system is shallow, but that it’s streamlined. The rules get complex when they need to, but never cumbersome, and wherever they could be cut out or simplified, they have been. Some of the highlights that get at the heart of <em>Open Legend</em> are explained below.</p><h2 class="md-display-1">Tell Stories of Legend, Not Cliché</h2><strong>ONE TYPE OF ROLL, INFINITE NUANCE OF CHARACTERS</strong><p>Unlink other RPGs, you\'re not forced to play a mostly similar character with a few levers or dials to customize. Instead, you build a character from zero (or select from one of our archetypes to get you started). No more abilities that don\'t match your personal vision for your character, buy only the abilities that fit. And unlike other classless systems, no plethora of charts and tables, just one type or roll for any action.</p><div class="fade-img" ng-if="homeCtrl.$mdMedia(\'xs\')"><a ng-href="/core-rules"><img src="/assets/img/open_legend_get_started.jpg" alt=""></a></div><h2 class="md-display-1">Smite Your Foes, Shield Your Friends</h2><strong>BANES & BOONS FOR EVERY CHARACTERS</strong><p><em>Open Legend</em> features a collection of banes and boons that any character can use as long as they are trained in the appropriate attributes. Banes allow you to stun your enemies, set them ablaze, or otherwise hinder them with devastating status effects. Boons are perks that you grant yourself or allies, such as magical healing, damage resistance, and flight. In <em>Open Legend</em>, no fighter is just a walking meat shield with a blade. He’s a trained combatant who can stun, blind, cripple, and hurl his foes across the battlefield. And when a sorceress summons an icy storm from the skies, she decides at the time of casting if she also wants it to slow, knockdown, or immobilize her enemies.</p><div class="fade-img" ng-if="homeCtrl.$mdMedia(\'xs\')"><a href="https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/38164/open-legend-playtest-series-2nd-session"><img src="/assets/img/open_legend_try_the_system.jpg" alt=""></a></div><h2 class="md-display-1">Roll Dice, Roll Lots of Dice</h2><strong>AND WATCH THEM EXPLODE</strong><p>In <em>Open Legend</em>, dice explode! That means that whenever any die rolls maximum, you get to reroll it and add the new roll to your total, ad infinitum. We love to tell a good story, but rolling dice is just so much fun, we thought that occasionally, you should get to roll a lot of them. The volatile nature of exploding dice makes every roll count, and every session of <em>Open Legend</em> is full of tense moments when the tides can turn at a moment’s notice, for better or worse.</p><div class="fade-img" ng-if="homeCtrl.$mdMedia(\'xs\')"><a href="https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/38164/open-legend-playtest-series-2nd-session"><img src="/assets/img/open_legend_try_the_system.jpg" alt=""></a></div><h2 class="md-display-1">Craft Your Setting, Create Your World</h2><strong>ANY GENRE, ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES</strong><p>The core rules are written to reflect a high fantasy, sword and sorcery setting, but <em>Open Legend</em> was purposefully designed to be open to any genre. The mechanics of the game focus on effects rather than flavor so that your gaming table can tell whatever kind of story it wants. Struggle for survival in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland. Soar amidst the clouds on your crystal-powered airship in a steampunk inspired campaign of swashbuckling sky pirates. Explore an alien-infested space station abandoned at the edge of the universe. The possibilities are endless.</p><h2 class="md-display-1">Share the Legend</h2><strong>OPEN SOURCE RULES</strong><p>That’s right. The core rules can be copied on internet forums, shared via PDF, etc. without fear of copyright infringement; they are released under a <a target="_blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY)</a>.
