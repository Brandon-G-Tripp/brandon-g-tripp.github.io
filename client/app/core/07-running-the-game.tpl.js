Answering the call to be the GM isn’t always easy, but your fellow game masters will agree that running a good campaign is perhaps the most satisfying act to be enjoyed within this fine hobby. Sure, the players get to slay dragons, amass wealth, and boast of their tales - but the GM gets to rest their head on the pillow after a late night session knowing that none of that fun would have been possible without them. The buzz of a well-run game is addicting, and we hope you’ll answer the call.</p><p>In this chapter, you’ll find everything you need to plan and execute legendary adventures and campaigns using the Open Legend rules system. You’ll learn how to plan challenges that are both exciting and fair, as well as how to reward the heroes so that they want to come back for more.</p><p>Before we get into all of that good stuff, though, let’s take a moment and explore what a good GM is, and perhaps more importantly, what a good GM isn’t.</p><p><strong>A good GM likes to tell a story.</strong> If you spent hours as a child developing elaborate worlds in your backyard or writing tales of adventure, or even drawing epic scenes, then you’re on the right track. Watching a story unfold based on your inspiration is perhaps one of the most enjoyable aspects of running a game.</p><p><strong>A good GM doesn’t railroad the players.</strong> While it is important for you to be well prepared with your story (or skilled at improvisation), you also need to remember that the players should have a meaningful role in how the story unfolds. Players will feel like they are stuck on a railroad from which the can’t escape, for example, if no matter what they do the princess still gets kidnapped, the city destroyed, or the ancient artifact stolen.</p><p><strong>A good GM knows the rules.</strong> As the game master, you may very well be the only one at the table who has read this rule book. That means you need to act as a teacher, director, and referee all at once. In particular, you should be prepared to know what each of the attributes can be used for, as well as the banes and boons that your players will be most likely to invoke.</p><p><strong>A good GM doesn’t let the rules slow the game down.</strong> Even though the rules are important, they are never more important than the fun being had at the table. Especially when you are first getting started with Open Legend, you may be tempted to pause the game every ten minutes to check the rule book. Ignore that urge. Epic stories can be told with the core mechanic alone. For your first few sessions, do your best working from your memory and take note of anything that you need to check up on later. If disputes arise, designate one player to look up the rules while the rest of the game goes on.</p><p><strong>A good GM knows when the players are having fun.</strong> Being a game master is an important job. It’s a lot like hosting a party. For 2 to 6 hours or so, you are the primary person responsible for entertaining a group of friends. So while you are running a game, it’s a good idea to take a moment, look around the room, and ask yourself Is everyone here enjoying themselves?</p><p><strong>A good GM doesn’t think that everyone defines fun in the same way.</strong> As you look around the room and gauge your table’s fun, it’s also important to realize that each person may come to the game for different reasons. Some just like to slay evil, others to make tactical chess-like decisions, others to tell epic stories, and still others to take on the role of realistic characters and watch them grow. Some players aren’t even all that into roleplaying games, but they love the social aspect of getting together. A good GM realizes that all of these play styles are acceptable. And, while you can’t please everyone all of the time you can try to make sure that everyone is having fun at some point during your games.</p><h2 id="creating-adventures">Creating Adventures</h2><p>Adventure is at the heart of every session of Open Legend. If the players aren’t spending their time exploring ruins, negotiating tense political situations, hunting down clues to mysteries, or slaying epic beasts on a regular basis, then your game needs more adventure.</p><p>This section will give you the information you need to start planning a variety of different types of exciting adventures.</p><h3 id="what-every-adventure-needs">What Every Adventure Needs</h3><p>To start planning your epic quests, you need three primary ingredients:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Danger</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Motivation</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Twist</strong></p></li></ul><p>The <strong>danger</strong> is the bad stuff that will happen if the players don’t intervene:</p><ul><li><p><em>Five children have been kidnapped by a witch who plans to cook them in a stew by sundown.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The Librim Protectis has gone missing from the royal library, and in it are the words of a spell that can unwind the magics which defend the city.</em></p></li><li><p><em>A host of orcs is sweeping the countryside, and the players’ village is next in their wake.</em></p></li></ul><p>All of these examples provide a real threat that needs to be taken care of by real heroes.</p><p>The <strong>motivation</strong> is the reason that the PCs are getting involved. Sometimes the danger and motivation are wrapped up in one, but imagine how much more invested the party would be in the above scenarios if one of the children was a nephew to a player, or if the Librim went missing on the party’s watch, or if the orc war chief had murdered one of their families.</p><p>The <strong>twist</strong> in an adventure is a surprise that throws the party off course or upsets their well laid plans. Or, it could just be an exciting change of plot that makes the story deeper than the players assumed. Maybe the witch is actually the town mayor. What if the players find the Librim Protectis in the hands of a local merchant who swears they have no idea how it fell into their hands. And perhaps the night before the orcs are set to launch their attack, the village scouts discover that a band of gnolls are approaching from the other side of town.</p><p>When planning an adventure, it’s usually fine to start with nothing more than a danger to overcome and a motivation to get the PCs invested. You can feel free to come up with a twist ahead of time, but some of the best plot twists occur as a natural result of the party’s actions.</p><p>Once you’ve got the starting pieces of your adventure sketched out, you can decide how you want to organize your adventure. Two common frameworks are described below: the sequential adventure and the sandbox adventure.</p><h3 id="the-sequential-adventure">The Sequential Adventure</h3><p>In this sort of quest, the GM plans out a logical sequence of encounters and scenes that the party will work their way through. These events could be location-based (such as exploring a series of chambers in the Ziggurat of Kings), or they could be time-based (such as negotiating a peace treaty with the barbarian tribes). An adventure often contains a healthy mix of both location- and time-based scenes, as in the example adventure sketched out below.</p><blockquote><h4 id="sample-sequential-adventure-outline-the-kidnappings-of-granny-maggot">Sample Sequential Adventure Outline: The Kidnappings of Granny Maggot</h4><p><strong>Danger:</strong> The children of Woodshold are disappearing one-by-one! Unbeknownst to the town, they are being collected by an evil hag named Granny Maggot for a dark ritual to cast the village into a deep malaise.</p><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The first child to go missing is Wort, nephew to one of the PCs.</p><p><strong>Events</strong></p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p><em>Hunters hanging around the tavern complain that Hunter’s Hill has gone completely barren of wildlife (as a result of Granny’s malicious but unknown presence).</em></p></li><li><p><em>A hunting party goes missing while exploring Hunter’s Hill. Granny’s lifeless scarecrows appear east of town after sunrise. The distraction caused to the town is the perfect opportunity for her to kidnap her first victim.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The party investigates the scene of the kidnapping, learning that the kidnapper left virtually no physical trace. Consulting a loremaster or simply via their own knowledge, the party surmises that a hag is the culprit.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Putting two and two together, the party investigates Hunter’s Hill and discovers Granny Maggot’s lair, carved out of a giant pumpkin in the deep of the wood. If they are successful in overcoming her minions and defeating the hag, the party may be able to free Wort.</em></p></li></ol></blockquote><p>To develop a sequential adventure, you just have to plot out the most logical sequence of events that will occur based on the party’s actions. Start with a simple list like the one above. It’s best not to get too specific, lest you fall into the trap of forcing the PCs into a single direction. Instead, leave your plan loose enough to redirect it according to how your players interact with the world. For example, what if the party never puts two and two together during their investigations in event 4 above? Maybe then a second child is kidnapped a few days later, but this time there is a witness who catches a glimpse of the hag.</p><h3 id="the-sandbox-adventure">The Sandbox Adventure</h3><p>A sandbox is so named because, to a certain extent, the players interact with the adventure in the same way that children explore a sandbox: at their own pace and for their own reasons. In this type of adventure, there is not typically a predictable order of events. Instead, the GM populates an area with plenty of opportunities for adventure and lets the story unfold naturally based on the players’ actions and the environment’s reactions. Just like a sequential adventure, a sandbox often contains both location- and time-based events. The outline below details a sandbox adventure revolving around a valley wilderness in which a barbarian tribe skirmishes with angelic visitors from another plane.</p><blockquote><h4 id="sample-sandbox-adventure-outline-the-scattered-souls">Sample Sandbox Adventure Outline: The Scattered Souls</h4><p><strong>Danger:</strong> A remote wilderness known as the Valley of Souls is home to a large collection of soul shards, magical crystals containing the lost souls of those killed in a cataclysmic war centuries ago. A team of angelic servants, called the Collectors, have been charged with retrieving these souls throughout the cosmos and returning them to their proper resting places among the outer planes. Unfortunately, two forces thwart their attempts within the Valley of Souls: a barbarian tribe whose sacred burial grounds contain the soul shards, and a demon named Vargax who seeks to devour the souls for his own.</p><p><strong>Motivation:</strong> The party happens upon the valley during their travels and are thrown into the battle when both the Collectors and the barbarians mistake the PCs for members of the opposition.</p><p><strong>Locations</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>The barbarian camps</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The barbarian burial grounds</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Caverns of Chaos</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The Collector camp</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong>Vargax Events</strong></p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p><em>Vargax sends an emissary to the barbarians. Vargax wins over the tribe’s trust by delivering the head of a Collector.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Vargax converts the barbarian shamans to worship him. The tribe as a whole begins transformation under demonic influence.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Vargax displaces the barbarian chief and assumes control of the tribe.</em></p></li></ol><p><strong>Collector Events</strong></p><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><p><em>The Collectors increase reconnaissance missions surrounding the barbarian camps.</em></p></li><li><p><em>With their newfound intelligence, the Collectors kidnap the son of the barbarian chief, demanding access to the burial grounds as ransom.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Civil war erupts within the tribe, with half of the barbarians supporting the chief’s decision to provide the ransom, and half opposing.</em></p></li><li><p><em>Infighting reduces the tribe’s strength significantly, allowing the Collectors to force their way into the burial grounds.</em></p></li></ol></blockquote><p>Developing a sandbox adventure is similar to developing a sequential one, in that you plan out the logical sequence of events. In this case, however, because the PCs have so much room for decision making, the outline differs slightly. The GM plans out all of the relevant locations to the adventure, perhaps mapping and populating them if necessary. Additionally, the GM will make a list for the key actors in the adventure. The list provides a series of events that will occur if the party does nothing to intervene.</p><p>In the above example, Vargax slowly carries out his plan to infiltrate the barbarians while the Collectors are attempting to create leverage so they can avoid an all out war with the tribes. More likely than not, when the adventure actually plays out, the GM won’t end up using all of the events outlined because the party <em>will</em> do something to intervene.</p><p>When planning your own sandbox adventures, it’s helpful to divide the different factions involved into two categories: active and passive. You only need to create a list of events for the active factions. In the example above, the barbarians are the monkey caught in the middle, and so they are a passive faction. They don’t need their own list because the plot that unfurls around them depends on the actions of the competing factions: the Collectors and Vargax.</p><h2 id="creating-a-campaign">Creating a Campaign</h2><p>In its simplest sense, a campaign is simply a string of adventures tied together by a common link. This link could simply be the party that is doing the adventuring. In this sort of episodic campaign, there may not be an overarching plot that ties each adventure together. As long as everyone at the table is having fun, this is perfectly fine.</p><p>More often than not, though, the players (and especially the GM) will want more depth in their campaign. This section contains the information you need to start telling your own ongoing stories with <em>Open Legend</em>.</p><h3 id="plan-the-big-secret">Plan The Big Secret</h3><p>One of the best ways to keep a story interesting and keep yourself inspired is to create one or more big secrets that slowly unfold throughout the campaign. Consider the following examples of big campaign secrets:</p><ul><li><p><em>The wizardly patron who advises the party throughout the campaign is actually an imprisoned red dragon manipulating them to win his freedom.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The world is cast in an endless darkness, not because of an ancient curse as legends tell, but because human civilization was forced underground eons ago. No one has ever discovered the “roof” of the world, so they assume that the sun is dead.</em></p></li><li><p><em>A world tree is the source of the planet’s life. When it dies, the world will not die, but instead be reborn in a new form. Every intelligent being is tied to an invisible spirit. A very few sinister mages, known as the Warlocks, have discovered how to see and bargain with these spirits in order to manipulate the world to their advantage.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The queen who sits on the throne has a twin sister who was cast out and left for dead at birth because she was prophesied to lead the kingdom to ruin. The twin survived, raised by an evil sorceress, and she will soon return to claim the half of the realm that is her birthright.</em></p></li></ul><p>The big secret is an ideal way to start planning your campaign because it will provide you with a common thread to weave every adventure together. Think of your favorite books, movies, or games if you are struggling to come up with a big secret.</p><h3 id="plan-the-campaign-arcs">Plan The Campaign Arcs</h3><p>Once you have your secret (or secrets) sketched out, you can begin to divide the campaign into arcs, or extended storylines that develop the plot and reveal the secrets. You can plan these out from the beginning of the campaign to the end, or you can just start with the first few legs of the campaign - enough to get you started without bogging you down. The following outline imagines how a campaign revolving around one of the aforementioned secrets might develop.</p><blockquote><h4 id="sample-campaign-outline">Sample Campaign Outline</h4><p><strong>Secret:</strong> The wizardly patron, Magus, who advises the party throughout the campaign is actually an imprisoned red dragon manipulating them to win his freedom.</p><p><strong>Campaign Arcs</strong></p><p><strong>Part 1:</strong> The party discovers Magus while exploring the Ruins of Excelsius.</p><p><strong>Part 2:</strong> The party assists Magus in recovering several items of power throughout the realm.</p><p><strong>Part 3:</strong> The party accidentally frees Magus. He reveals his true form and begins laying waste to the realm. The PCs work to gather allies to combat the army of giants the dragon is acquiring.</p><p><strong>Part 4:</strong> A final war erupts between Magus’s giants and the alliance of good. The party hunts Magus down to his volcanic lair.</p></blockquote><p>Like most of the steps laid out in this guide to GMing, your campaign arcs should be planned relatively loosely to allow for players to shape the story by their own actions.</p><h3 id="plan-enough-to-get-started">Plan Enough to Get Started</h3><p>Once you’ve got your secret and arcs written down, the final step is to plan out enough to get you started. Develop the maps, NPCs, factions, and other elements that you need to get the party through their first couple of adventures. Resist the urge to make everything perfect and plan for every possible player action.</p><p>And start with what you love to do. The GM has a big job, so stick to developing the campaign elements that excite you. Some GMs can spend an afternoon drawing an entire world map, and the act of creating that world inspires them with an infinite number of dungeons, plotlines, and adventures to keep the players happy for a year. Other GMs start with a list of NPCs or factions, thinking through their motivations and personalities. Creating this cast of characters allows them to imagine a host of conflicts and conspiracies that will naturally transform into dramatic encounters once the PCs are thrown into the mix. Still other game masters love to start with memorable combat encounters and action scenes, and connect the dots of plot and setting as these epic battles take shape. Whatever aspect of GMing interests you the most, that is where you should start.</p><h3 id="rewarding-the-players">Rewarding the Players</h3><p>The thrill of adventure, the satisfaction of character development, and the joy of seeing a plotline come to its fulfillment are all intrinsically rewarding events that keep players coming back to the gaming table week after week. But still, just as players of any game, your players will also enjoy good old-fashioned extrinsic motivators. In Open Legend, these sorts of rewards typically come in two forms: wealth and power.</p><h4 id="how-and-when-to-award-xp">How and When to Award XP</h4><p>In Open Legend, the primary way that players gain more power is by gaining experience points (XP) and reaching higher character levels, thus increasing their attribute scores and unlocking new feats, banes, and boons. Every XP that players receive grants them 1 feat point and 3 attribute points, and every 3 XP results in a new level.</p><p>Rather than constantly awarding different experience point values to different monsters or types of challenges, Open Legend uses a very simple method of determining when players level up: the GM. That’s right. You get to decide when your players gain more power. Here are two methods you can use to decide how to award XP:</p><p><strong>Big Milestones.</strong> You could award a new level whenever the players complete a major quest, defeat a powerful foe, or neutralize a serious threat. With this method, you may want to plan out the big milestones that you can foresee being accomplished in your campaign. Whenever your players reach one of these milestones, you give them 3 XP and thus a new level. A milestone map might look something like this:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Level 2:</strong> The heroes thwart one of the three foes threatening Woodshold.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level 3:</strong> The heroes discover the Cult of the Dragon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level 4:</strong> The heroes prevent the cult’s Ritual of Three from being completed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level 5:</strong> The heroes retrieve the treasure at the bottom of the Sunken Star.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level 6:</strong> The heroes end the conflict between the barbarians and the Collectors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level 7:</strong> The heroes free the village of Hilltop from the grasp of the vampire Tessa.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level 8:</strong> The heroes discover the secret of the Ruins of Mastika.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level 9:</strong> The heroes find a way to weaken Dezzer Kai’s power over the land.</p></li><li><p><strong>Level 10:</strong> The heroes defeat Dezzer Kai.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Time Played.</strong> An easy way to schedule rewards is simply to give players 1 XP at the end of each session. This way, they’ll always look forward to gaining that little extra bit of power that comes from attributes and feats. Occasionally, you may decide to switch it up a bit and award players with 2 or even 3 XP if they accomplished a particularly important goal. With this method, you don’t have to plan out a campaign’s milestones ahead of time, but you may need to adapt on the fly to your players’ increasing power.</p><h5 id="beyond-10th-level">Beyond 10th Level</h5><p>Although officially, Open Legend was designed with a maximum character level of 10, there is no reason you can’t extend your campaign beyond this threshold if you are up for the challenge (higher level characters can be difficult to manage and properly engineer challenges for). Feel free to continue the campaign for as many levels as is fun for both you and your players. To do so, simply continue the established progression of 3 XP to gain a new level, with each XP also providing 1 feat point and 3 attribute points.</p><h4 id="all-that-glitters-giving-players-more-wealth">All That Glitters: Giving Players More Wealth</h4><p>In addition to power, most players enjoy being able to have more influence on the campaign world by amassing hoards of treasure. With money comes the ability to buy better equipment, employ hirelings, construct fortifications, and even raise armies.</p><p>Chapter 4 explains Open Legend’s simplified wealth system, and the Wealth Overview Table indicates the typical wealth score of PCs at varying experience levels. Players start with a wealth score of 2 and it will increase whenever the GM decides. Just as experience levels represent a vast increase in power, new wealth scores drastically improve the players’ access to valuable goods. A character who goes from wealth 3 to 4, for example, has progressed from being able to purchase a fine horse to being able to buy a siege engine.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Wealth Overview</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="width:25%;"><colgroup><col width="5%"><col width="9%"><col width="9%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="center">Wealth Score</th><th align="left">Sample Lifestyles</th><th align="left">Sample Goods</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center">0</td><td align="left">beggar, street urchin</td><td align="left">3 square meals and a warm bed</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">1</td><td align="left">unskilled laborer</td><td align="left">a night on the town, leather armor, simple weapons</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">2</td><td align="left">skilled laborer, town guardsman, 1st level hero</td><td align="left">martial weapons, scale mail armor, a good horse, a raft</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">3</td><td align="left">master artisan, village mayor</td><td align="left">full plate armor, silver weapons, a small boat, a fine horse</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">4</td><td align="left">4th level hero, noble, city mayor</td><td align="left">elven full plate, a small ship, a siege engine</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">5</td><td align="left">lord of a realm, thieves’ guild master in a large city</td><td align="left">a large cargo ship, a city wall</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">6</td><td align="left">7th level hero</td><td align="left">a large warship</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">7</td><td align="left">king</td><td align="left">a stronghold, startup funding for a new town</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">8</td><td align="left">10th level hero</td><td align="left">startup funding for a new city, an army of 10,000</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">9</td><td align="left">emperor</td><td align="left">a castle, an army of 50,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can use this table as a rough guideline for when to give players more wealth, particularly if you have also created an outline of milestones for granting experience levels. For example, the table shows that by 4th level, a typical character should have progressed to wealth score 4. Using the experience level milestone plan detailed previously, we could decide that after stopping the first threat to Woodshold, the people of the town take up a collection to reward the heroes. We can also plan to give the Cult of the Dragon a horde of treasure that will again increase the party’s wealth score.</p><p>However you plan to award wealth, you can see that the general recommendation on the table is for a PC’s wealth score to increase twice every three levels.</p><p>If you or your players have a background with other game systems, in which they may have regularly looted every corpse, scavenged every piece of equipment, and dutifully tracked every single gold piece, then Open Legend’s wealth system might initially feel a bit awkward. If it does, consider some of the following tips:</p><p><strong>NPCs still have stuff on them.</strong> Just because you don’t need to spend hours tracking every piece of loot that the players cut from a corpse doesn’t mean that they don’t have stuff on them. It just fades into the background so that you can focus on the story.</p><p>Think of any movie or novel. How often does the action focus on the characters picking at the defeated bodies of the antagonists? Rarely. And, if they do take something from a foe, it’s usually to serve the plot.</p><p>So, when a combat encounter ends, instead of listing off how many crossbow bolts each bandit has on them, just tell the party that they find a few valuables to add to their ever-growing stash, but that it’s still not enough to increase their wealth score. If a player does legitimately need bolts or another dagger or a new cloak, then you can decide whether or not it makes sense for the NPCs to have them.</p><p><strong>Wealth represents influence.</strong> Since players aren’t tracking individual gold pieces and gems, situations like bribery might initially prove to be a bit sticky. But a good guideline is that a character can easily use money to influence someone else of a lower wealth score.</p><p>If the recipient of the bribe has the <strong>same wealth score</strong> as the character, then it would be considered a “major expense”, which means that it can be done, but the expense taxes resources such that new goods at that level or higher can’t be acquired for two weeks. If the bribe recipient is <strong>one wealth level higher</strong> than the character’s Wealth Score, the cost is so great that the character’s Wealth Score is permanently reduced by 1. Bribing someone more than one Wealth level higher is impossible without other factors in play.</p><p>So, a character with a wealth score of 2 will be inconvenienced in bribing a town guard, and a character probably needs a wealth score of 5 before they can easily bribe powerful political figures like the town mayor.</p><p>Keep these same guidelines in mind when it comes to arbitrating similar situations, such as players trying to hire laborers, schmooze with bigwigs, or impress a crowd with their wealth.</p><h2 id="monsters-and-npcs">Monsters and NPCs</h2><p>No campaign or adventure is complete without monsters for the heroes to defeat or NPCs for them to overcome. When planning out a campaign or adventure, consider that the monsters and NPCs of your story typically fall into one of the following categories:</p><ul><li><p>Henchmen</p></li><li><p>Villains</p></li><li><p>Allies</p></li></ul><h3 id="henchmen">Henchmen</h3><p>Henchman is a general term to describe any antagonist who simply exists as a small obstacle to the party’s short term plans. Examples of henchmen include a wandering band of orcs that waylays the party during their travels, a mindless ooze roaming the deep corners of a cavernous dungeon, and a team of assassins dispatched by the local thieves’ guild to put an end to the heroes’ meddling. While henchmen typically have realistic motives, their influence on the plot is small enough that you don’t need to spend as much energy to make your henchmen deep and convincing. The orcs are motivated by greed, the ooze by hunger, and the assassins by loyalty to their guild.</p><h3 id="villains">Villains</h3><p>The villain of a plotline is the primary antagonist, and your players will likely deal with multiple villains throughout their careers. Examples include the necromancer who has taken up residence in the local graveyard, the demon who pulls the strings from behind the throne, and the bandit king who has united the ruffians of the realm under one banner. Unlike henchmen, your villains will require a good amount of thought to flesh out. To develop strong, convincing villains, consider the following elements.</p><p><strong>Motive.</strong> Every villain should have a realistic motive, or a reason for turning towards their villainous ways. Instead of deciding that your necromancer is simply evil, for example, consider making them fallen. Perhaps they turned to necromancy as a last resort to revive their beloved partner who was killed in a shipwreck.</p><p><strong>Scheme.</strong> Your villain’s scheme is the evil deed they have set out to complete. The scheme is often tied directly to the motive. For example, rather than the necromancer simply being set on snuffing the life out of the town, their scheme involves sacrificing ten villagers as part of a ritual to return their partner to life.</p><p><strong>Flaw.</strong> A flaw is part of what makes a villain human (even if the villain is an ancient wyrm). A flaw could be a physical vulnerability, such as the bare patch of Smaug’s left breast, or it could be a social, mental, or emotional insufficiency. Our necromancer, for example, could be easily set into a blind rage against anyone who speaks ill of their beloved.</p><h3 id="allies">Allies</h3><p>NPCs aren’t limited to antagonists, of course. Many of the most important characters to your plotline will be allies of the heroes. Perhaps the party is guided by a wisened sage who secludes himself in a high tower and for unknown reasons allows only the PCs access to his wisdom. Another example includes a team of native elves who have been dispatched to see the heroes safely through a haunted wood.</p><p>Whatever sorts of allies the party has acquired, it’s important for the GM to abide by a few guidelines to ensure that the allies add to the fun rather than detract from it.</p><p><strong>Allies should empower the heroes, not outshine them.</strong> Effective allies provide the players with the power or opportunity to achieve even greater deeds. To put it another way, the allies should help the party shine rather than take the spotlight for themselves. Players want to be the main characters of their story, so it’s important to avoid the temptation to make your NPCs the center of attention. Although these tactics might work in some situations, you should generally shy away from the following:</p><ul><li><p>Allowing an NPC to sweep in and save the day.</p></li><li><p>Having an NPC be the primary damage dealer in a fight.</p></li><li><p>Creating situations in which the players feel forced to take an NPC’s orders or advice.</p></li></ul><p>There are no hard and fast rules, however. If you find NPCs in your game frequently doing the above, then there’s a good chance your players might become frustrated.</p><p>But sometimes it can add to the story to have an ally contribute in a way that the players can’t, but it’s important to find some purpose for the players to fulfill that the NPC can’t for one reason or another. For example, a powerful enemy mage controls the minds of a group of soldiers with the <em>Dominated</em> bane and commands them to attack the players. A powerful ally NPC might use Protection magic to call upon the <em>Restoration</em> boon to protect the minds of the players by breaking the influence over them and half of the soldiers. However, the NPC isn’t capable of providing this protection for all of the soldiers - the players must then complete the vital task of subduing (ideally without killing) the <em>Dominated</em> soldiers and preventing them from killing anyone.</p><p>The above example will likely be an intriguing scene enjoyed by all, because the ally NPC can’t prevail without the help of the players.</p><p><strong>Allies can be used to grant knowledge.</strong> In addition to providing players with new power, allies can also be the purveyors of information. A savvy merchant knows how to gain leverage on the members of the trader’s guild; a pitiful sanitation clerk turned wererat possesses the only known map of the city sewers; a sage who acts as patron to the party has discovered the location of the Ring of Worlds. By using allies to inform the players of secret or hidden knowledge, you put the power of what to do with that information in the PCs’ hands.</p><p><strong>Allies should be imperfect.</strong> The best allies are the ones who are flawed just like the PCs. They have physical weaknesses that can be taken advantage of, moral faults that can be exploited, or needs that they can’t fulfill on their own. If the allies are so powerful that no mortal can stop them and they want for nothing, the players are likely to wonder why the NPC is giving them the time of day in the first place, and, by finding ways to demonstrate your NPCs’ imperfections, you’ll further immerse your players in the fantasy.</p><h3 id="monsters-and-npc-statistics">Monsters and NPC Statistics</h3><p>Many of the monsters and NPCs that the PCs encounter throughout their journey will be used solely for the purposes of role playing or setting the mood. These sort of background characters typically don’t need a full array of attributes, feats, and favored banes because, more likely than not, you’ll never make a single action roll for them. Angus the Blacksmith, for example, might spice up the town bazaar a bit with his Scottish accent and epic tales of fraudulent accomplishments - but your party is never going to need to engage him in combat.</p><p>A good deal of your monsters and NPCs, however, will require statistical descriptions to use for combat or social encounters. This section will describe two ways that you can build these statistics: the complex build and the simple build.</p><h4 id="complex-build">Complex Build</h4><p>When designing an NPC using the complex build, you simply create the NPC as if it was a player character. Select an appropriate level and use the instructions in chapter one to assign attributes, feats, and other defining characteristics.</p><p>The complex build is a good option when you are creating a very important villain or ally who will play a major role in the story line. This process can take a while, so it’s not worth going through with underlings, henchmen, or beasts who are only going to be present for a single scene.</p><h4 id="simple-build">Simple Build</h4><p>The simple build option is useful when you need to come up with statistics on the fly. For example, imagine the party fails an action roll to move stealthily through a swamp to avoid the local denizens. You decide that they have attracted the attention of a handful of poisonous serpents that lair in the swamp, but you don’t have any stats written up for these monsters. In this situation, you could use the simple build rules to get combat rolling quickly.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>NPC SIMPLE BUILD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr class="header"><th align="center">NPC Level</th><th align="center">Hit Points</th><th align="center">Defenses</th><th align="center">Primary Attributes</th><th align="center">Secondary Attributes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">10 - 22</td><td align="center">10 - 18</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">12 - 24</td><td align="center">11 - 18</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">14 - 26</td><td align="center">12 - 19</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">16 - 28</td><td align="center">13 - 19</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">18 - 30</td><td align="center">14 - 20</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">20 - 32</td><td align="center">15 - 21</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">22 - 34</td><td align="center">16 - 22</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">6</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">24 - 36</td><td align="center">17 - 23</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">6</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">26 - 38</td><td align="center">18 - 24</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">7</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">28 - 40</td><td align="center">19 - 25</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">7</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Use the NPC Simple Build Table to determine the monster’s most relevant statistics. For the hit point and defense columns, choose values within the given ranges based on the strengths and weaknesses of the monster you are building. Choose 1 to 3 primary attributes that will form the main basis of the monster’s attacks and actions, and then choose as many secondary attributes as you need in order to define the monster’s other capabilities.</p><p>Once you have the basic statistics recorded, choose a few of the following feats to provide your monster with special attacks and abilities:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Attack Specialization (tier equal to NPC level, max 9):</strong> With one attack type, gain advantage 1 per tier.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bane Focus:</strong> Pick a bane. Whenever a damaging attack exceeds the target’s defense by 5 or more, you may automatically inflict that bane.</p></li><li><p><strong>Superior Bane Focus (available only to GMs):</strong> Pick a bane. Whenever you inflict at least one damage with an attack, you may automatically inflict that bane.</p></li><li><p><strong>Boon Focus (tier 1 - 3, your choice):</strong> Pick a boon. Gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> When you invoke the chosen boon on a single target, you succeed automatically and do not need to make an action roll. You can invoke the boon at any of the power levels you could access via your other means. If the invocation is not a single target, success is not automatic, but you get advantage 2 on the action roll to invoke the boon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> You gain advantage 3 on your action roll to invoke the boon if you are not single-targeting. Additionally, you may invoke the boon one time increment faster, as follows: If the invocation time is a major action or move action, it becomes a minor action. If the invocation time is 1 focus action, it becomes 1 major action. If the invocation time is 1 minute, it becomes 1 focus action. If the invocation time is 10 minutes, it becomes 1 minute. If the invocation time is 1 hour, it becomes 10 minutes. If the invocation time is 8 hours, it becomes 1 hour.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tier 3:</strong> This boon is always active for your character and passively persists, without requiring your concentration (though it can be temporarily dispelled until your next turn when it automatically resumes). If the invocation is not a single target, success is not automatic, but you get advantage 4 on the action roll to invoke it.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Energy Resistance (tier 1 - 3, your choice):</strong> Choose an energy type and gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Prevent the first 5 damage you would suffer each round from the chosen energy type.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> All damage you would suffer from the chosen type is halved.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tier 3:</strong> You are immune to the chosen energy type.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Evasive Footwork:</strong> When you move from a square adjacent to an enemy to another square not adjacent to that enemy, the enemy does not get the usual opportunity attack.</p></li><li><strong>Lethal Strike (tier equal to NPC level, max 9):</strong> Lethal strikes can be delivered to do lethal damage (that does not heal normally) under specific circumstances. There are two different ways to deliver a lethal strike:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Catch an enemy by surprise, either due to not seeing you via Agility or through disguise / subterfuge via Deception.</li><li>If an enemy is adjacent to an ally wielding a melee weapon, then you can make a lethal strike against that enemy.</li></ol><p>If one of the above conditions is met, you can deliver a lethal strike, which grants advantage and deals lethal damage in accordance with your tier and is difficult to recover from. Each tier below has an amount of advantage and a max lethal damage. If you deal damage up to the lethal threshold, then the lethal damage equals your damage total. If you deal more damage than the lethal threshold, you deal lethal damage equal to the threshold.</p><ul><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - Advantage 1, Max lethal damage 5</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Advantage 2, Max lethal damage 10</li><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - Advantage 3, Max lethal damage 15</li><li><strong>Tier 4</strong> - Advantage 4, Max lethal damage 15</li><li><strong>Tier 5</strong> - Advantage 5, Max lethal damage 20</li><li><strong>Tier 6</strong> - Advantage 6, Max lethal damage 20</li><li><strong>Tier 7</strong> - Advantage 7, Max lethal damage 25</li><li><strong>Tier 8</strong> - Advantage 8, Max lethal damage 25</li><li><strong>Tier 9</strong> - Advantage 9, Max lethal damage 30</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Multi-Attack Specialist (tier equals NPC level, max 6):</strong> When you make an attack, you can choose to incur disadvantage 3, in exchange for an additional attack. You can use this ability to gain more than one additional attack. You can move between each of these attacks or otherwise divide them. You must decide before your first attack whether or not to use this feat. The disadvantage applies to all attacks for this turn. For each tier of this feat you offset the disadvantage penalty by 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-Target Attack Specialist (tier equals NPC level, max 5):</strong> Choose either area, projectile, or melee when you take this feat. For each tier, you offset the disadvantage penalty associated with by 1. So, when you would normally get disadvantage 2, you instead get disadvantage 1 and so on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multi-Bane Specialist:</strong> Choose two banes that you are able to inflict and that share a common prerequisite attribute. You are able to inflict both banes with a single attack. The required attribute score for combining the banes is equal to the sum of their power levels (e.g., combining knockdown and slowed, both power level 2, would require an attribute score of 4). If the banes target different defenses, you choose which defense your attack targets. On a successful attack roll, the target is inflicted with both banes. They each persist independently of one another and must be resisted separately.</p></li><li><p><strong>Potent Bane:</strong> Choose a bane. When you invoke the chosen bane on a target, Resist rolls to shake off the bane have disadvantage 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resilient:</strong> Any time you roll to Resist, you have advantage 1 on the roll.</p></li><li><p><strong>Superior Concentration (tier 1 - 3, your choice):</strong> Without this feat, only a single boon can be persisted with the Sustain minor action. Purchasing this feat allows you to sustain one additional boon simultaneously without losing focus on the others you are already focusing on.<br><strong>Special</strong>: This feat can be purchased multiple times (up to a maximum of 3), each time it is purchased you can maintain one more boon with the Sustain minor action.</p></li></ul><blockquote><h4 id="example-simple-monster-build-swamp-snakes">Example Simple Monster Build: Swamp Snakes</h4><p>Returning to the example at the beginning of this section, let’s build our venomous swamp snakes imagining that the party is made up of 3rd level characters, and thus we choose to make the Swamp Snakes using the row for level 3 Monsters. We decide that the snakes aren’t particularly tough to kill, so referencing the Simple Build Table, we’ll give them the low end of the suggested range and settle on 14 hit points each. When it comes to defenses, snakes are fast, mildly sturdy, and weak willed. So, we’ll go with the high range for Guard: 18, the middle range for Toughness: 15, and the low range for Resolve: 12. We’ll only assign one primary attribute, giving the snakes an Agility of 5, and we’ll assign Perception, Fortitude, and Deception as secondary attributes with a score of 4.</p><p>When it comes to feats, we decide to highlight the danger of the venom by choosing Multi Bane Specialist and Bane Focus to allow the snakes to inflict both the stunned and persistent damage banes whenever they land a damaging attack that exceeds the target’s defense by 5 or more.</p></blockquote><h4 id="boss-monsters-and-npcs">Boss Monsters and NPCs</h4><p>A Boss is a single monster or NPC that is capable of taking on a group of characters due to extraordinary prowess in combat. Bosses could be epic villains that the party has been pursuing for the entire campaign, such as the Lich King Akrakus, or they could be monstrous beasts with little backstory that simply serve as a dramatic milestone in the course of a larger adventure, such as a bridge troll that must be defeated before the PCs can progress. Other examples of bosses include the Kraken, a legendary swordsman, a dragon, or an orc warchief.</p><p>When you decide that one of your monsters or NPCs merits boss status, use the Boss Monster Build Table to generate statistics in the same way you would if using the simple build rules described previously. You’ll notice that bosses have more hit points, higher defenses, and better attributes in order to account for their ability to take on entire parties of PCs alone. When using the complex build, you can alter your villain’s hit points and defenses based on this table to better represent the appropriate strength of a boss.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>BOSS MONSTER BUILD</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="width:33%;"><colgroup><col width="5%"><col width="5%"><col width="5%"><col width="5%"><col width="5%"><col width="5%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="center">Boss Level</th><th align="center">Hit Points</th><th align="center">Defenses</th><th align="center">Primary Attributes</th><th align="center">Secondary Attributes</th><th align="center">Boss Actions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">40</td><td align="center">13 - 16</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">1</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">50</td><td align="center">14 - 17</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">1</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">60</td><td align="center">15 - 18</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">70</td><td align="center">16 - 19</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">70</td><td align="center">17 - 20</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">80</td><td align="center">18 - 21</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">80</td><td align="center">19 - 22</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">90</td><td align="center">20 - 23</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">90</td><td align="center">21 - 24</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">22 - 25</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">4</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Boss Actions</strong></p><p>In addition to its normal allotment of actions, a boss will also receive one or more boss actions on its turn. When rolling initiative for a boss, make an extra number of initiative rolls for each boss action. When arranging the initiative order, there must be at least one PC between each of the boss’s turns. If necessary, move the “boss action” turns lower in the order to accommodate this requirement.</p><p>During combat, the boss monster’s highest initiative count indicates its normal turn, during which it gets the usual allotment of major, move, and minor actions. Each of the boss’s lower counts in the initiative are boss actions, which allow the boss to make one major action.</p><h2 id="planning-combat-encounters">Planning Combat Encounters</h2><p>The build rules just explained help you create individual monsters or NPCs for the heroes to combat, and this section will assist you in building exciting scenarios for those battles.</p><h3 id="encounter-difficulty">Encounter Difficulty</h3><p>When designing a combat encounter, decide if you want it to be easy, moderate, or hard. An <strong>easy encounter</strong> shouldn’t present a significant threat to the PCs unless luck is wildly against them or they make a series of poor decisions. A <strong>moderate encounter</strong> will challenge the PCs, but they are still likely to come out on top. A <strong>hard encounter</strong> will push them to the limits, and may end in defeat or the death of one or more characters.</p><p>Use the Encounter Difficulty Table to determine how many total monster levels you should include in your combat.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr class="header"><th align="center">Encounter Difficulty</th><th align="center">Total Monster Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center">Easy</td><td align="center">Total Party Level x .5</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">Moderate</td><td align="center">Total Party Level x 1</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">Hard</td><td align="center">Total Party Level x 2</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For example, a moderate encounter for a group of 4 PCs who are all 5th level would have a Total Monster Level of 20. An easy encounter for the same group would have a Total Monster Level of 10, and a hard encounter 40.</p><p>Whether you are using the simple or complex method of building your NPCs, you can spend your monster level budget until you reach approximately the designated total monster level for your encounter.</p><h4 id="bosses">Bosses</h4><p>If your encounter includes boss monsters, multiply their level by 4 for purposes of budgeting (i.e., a 5th level boss would be worth 20 levels).</p><h4 id="minions">Minions</h4><p>When designing an encounter, you may want to designate some monsters as minions, or easily dispensable grunts that still pose a threat to the party. You can trade any monster for three minions of the same level. Minions have the same stats as any other monster of their level, but their hit points are divided by four. Essentially, minions.</p><p>For example, imagine you are planning an easy encounter with a horde of goblins for a group of six 1st level heroes. Your monster level budget would only allow you to include six 1st level monsters, but you decide to replace them all with minions, allowing you to include 18 goblins.</p><h3 id="encounter-setting">Encounter Setting</h3><p>Rarely do epic movie fight scenes take place in an empty chamber. There are usually chandeliers to swing from, jets of flame to avoid, ledges to leap from, or rafters to balance upon. When designing an encounter, think about how you can use the setting to inspire the deeds of legend that your players will be talking about for years to come. Here are a few ideas:</p><p><strong>Multiple Levels.</strong> Staircases, ledges, boulders, pits, and other terrain that combatants can ascend or descend will make combat interesting by empowering ranged attacks and spotlighting players who are built for maneuverability.</p><p><strong>Difficult Terrain.</strong> A pool of sludge that cuts movement speed in half or a thin beam that provides a perilous shortcut to the big boss are the sorts of options that allow PCs to make meaningful decisions with their move actions.</p><p><strong>Hazards.</strong> Consider adding an extra count in the initiative for some sort of natural or extraordinary hazard, such as a steaming geyser or poisonous mushroom spore. Once per round, randomly choose a PC or two to fall victim to these perils of the battlefield.</p><h3 id="encounter-consequences">Encounter Consequences</h3><p>Not every fight that your party gets into needs to be a knock down drag out fight to the death, nor does every encounter need to have a binary win/loss condition. When determining how a fight ends, remember to consider the motivations of the combatants and the demands of the plot. Are the PCs worth more to the orc chief alive than dead? Will the story be more interesting if the dragon doesn’t wipe out the entire party? Consider some of the following possibilities whenever deciding how a fight will end.</p><p><strong>Don’t be afraid to end it early.</strong> Sometimes, despite all your plans, a combat just takes too long. Or maybe the party’s luck runs dry and they spend four rounds trying to kill the last two carnivorous shrubs. It’s okay to fast-forward the combat when things are going stale and everyone at the table is ready for the next scene. Simply narrate the gist of what happens, and move on. Generally, you should only do this if the combat is obviously going to end in the PCs’ favor. If the bad guys are winning, most parties will likely want to fight to the bitter end. If fast-forwarding to a party defeat, be sure that ALL of your players are agreeable first.</p><p><strong>Partial defeat is more interesting than a total party kill.</strong> Battles are much greater swirling maelstroms of chaos than our gridded battle mats, top-down views, and sequential turns would lead us to believe. This means that the GM has plenty of wiggle room for creating outcomes that might not have come up in the blow-by-blow narrative of the encounter. So, if the entire party is knocked unconscious or otherwise defeated, you are well within your rights to say that, for example, one of the PCs stumbled out of sight unnoticed before passing out, or that the monsters leave half of the party for dead and capture the few that they think are still alive. Little twists like this allow the players a chance to turn a loss into an epic tale for revenge or recovery.</p><p><strong>Hard decisions test a hero’s mettle.</strong> A favorite tactic of super villains everywhere is to force the hero to decide between winning the fight or saving a mass of helpless bystanders. Combat encounters in Open Legend can also end in tough decisions for the party: the sorcerer hovers over a magma filled chasm so that landing the final blow also means destroying the magical staff he wields, the hill giant reveals that he has a family captive in a cave which he will only reveal if his life is spared, and so on. Though your players will get tired of these tactics if they are used excessively, forcing hard choices on your heroes will help them define their characters and prove their loyalties.</p><p><strong>Death is okay, sometimes.</strong> The above suggestions aren’t meant to imply that you should never kill off a PC (or four). They are simply illustrations of the variety of ways that a fight can end in an interesting manner. Sometimes, heroes die, and if your players know that character death is a real possibility, it will make their victories and exploits all the more legendary. If a character does need to die, though, make sure they go out with a bang, with an epic story to be sung by bards for ages eternal.</p><h3 id="on-balance-and-fairness">On Balance and Fairness</h3><p>When planning your encounters, you do not need to strive for balance, but you should aim to be fair to your players.</p><p>Video games are balanced: they are designed to present players with incremental challenges that grow in difficulty alongside the power of the player. Because of the inherent lack of openness and choice in most video games, players would easily get frustrated if the challenges weren’t balanced to their progress in the game.</p><p>Role playing games, on the other hand, aren’t meant to be balanced all of the time. They are meant to be immersive. They are meant to allow players to push the limits of possibility in fantastical worlds. This level of freedom means that sometimes the heroes will come face to face with threats that they cannot overcome.</p><p>As a GM, you don’t need to have any anxiety over putting an impossible challenge before your party. But you do have to be fair about it. You are responsible for warning the party to the danger that lies ahead. It would be unfair, for example, to drop an ancient red wyrm upon an unsuspecting party of first level PCs with no option to escape. It would be perfectly fair, however, if the party encounters the dragon after exploring the ancient ruins that make his lair despite warnings from the locals and tremors that grow stronger with every step deeper into the ruins.</p>');
