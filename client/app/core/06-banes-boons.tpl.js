They represent the endless possibilities of effects that your character can have on other characters beyond simply dealing damage. Banes are negative conditions that you inflict upon your foes, such as by stunning them, demoralizing them, or setting them on fire. Boons are the opposite: helpful effects that assist your allies by allowing them to fly, shrug off damage, or move with extraordinary speed.</p><p>Banes and boons are not tied to specific spells, attacks, or items. Any character can invoke any bane or boon as long as the character possesses a prerequisite attribute. Attribute prerequisites are meant to limit the power of banes and boons so that they scale as your character gains power. That is why, for example, your first level necromancer can invoke the <em>Blindsight</em> boon with their Entropy attribute of 5, but won’t be able to invoke the <em>Insubstantial</em> boon for themself or their allies until they gain enough experience to increase their Entropy to 7.</p><h2 id="telling-your-story-with-banes-and-boons">Telling Your Story with Banes and Boons</h2><p>Because <em>Open Legend</em> focuses on separating the mechanics from the story, when you invoke a bane or boon, you get to decide what it looks like in the narrative. For example, did you <em>Knockdown</em> a foe with an agile sweep kick, a herculean shove, or a telekinetic thrust? When you grant your allies <em>Resistance</em>, do they become coated in armor of ice or are they protected by a swarm of droids that surround them and deflect attacks?</p><h3 id="with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility">With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility</h3><p>When you browse these lists, you will find that your attributes grant access to far more banes and boons than you could typically make use of. Sometimes, attributes can mean different things for different types of characters. For example, imagine using the <em>Alteration</em> attribute to invoke the <em>Shapeshift</em> boon - a Druid would do so to turn into a massive bear, while a genetically enhanced military operative might assume the identity of a high profile enemy commander. These examples of using <em>Shapeshift</em> make sense and follow our normal expectations from similar stories, but <em>Alteration</em> also grants access to the <em>Invisible</em> boon. This can be confusing, because having access to a bane or boon might make you feel that you should use it, but that’s not necessarily the case. The best time to use a bane or boon is when it adds to the story and makes the game more fun for everyone.</p><p>In <em>Open Legend</em>, we use the rules to make sure the game is fair and that everyone gets equal opportunity to drive the story forward - we don’t use the rules to ensure the game is logical. Whether or not a story makes sense or is enjoyable is a matter of personal preference. <em>Open Legend</em> expects that these details will be worked out</p><hr><p>between the players and the GM during a game. Certain attributes give you access to an incredible toolbox of banes and boons, but it is the responsibility of everyone playing the game to respect each other’s wish to tell a story that the group can get excited about. So, while your Druid with <em>Alteration</em> might not have a good excuse to become <em>Invisible</em>, the rules make it possible just in case, and in the process it also becomes possible to play an alien psychic warrior that uses <em>Alteration</em> to bend waves of light and become <em>Invisible</em>.</p><h2 id="invoking-banes-and-boons">Invoking Banes and Boons</h2><p>To invoke a bane, the primary method is to succeed at an appropriate attribute roll using one of your target’s defense scores as the Challenge Rating, as indicated in the bane description. An alternate method of invoking a bane is to make a successful damaging attack that exceeds the target’s defense by 10 or more. When this happens, you may apply one bane of a Power Level less than or equal to the attribute you used for the attack. In order to apply a bane, your attack roll must equal or exceed the appropriate defense for that bane. If your attack targeted multiple foes, you may apply the bane to each qualifying target. While targets may be effected by multiple banes, banes do not <em>stack</em>; A bane cannot be inflicted on a target already suffering from it, unless the bane’s effect says so (the <em>fatigued</em> bane, for example).</p><p>To invoke a boon, you must succeed at an appropriate attribute roll with a Challenge Rating determined by the boon’s Power Level. The CR equals 10 + 2 x Power Level. If a boon can be invoked at multiple Power Levels, you decide which Power Level to invoke after making your action roll. While targets may be effected by different boons, you may not <em>stack</em> the same boon multiple times; if a second invocation of a boon would affect a character, they choose which boon to keep and which one to negate.</p><p>Additional details about invoking banes and boons, such as attack range and targeting multiple creatures, can be found in Chapter 6: Combat.</p><h2 id="reading-a-bane-description">Reading a Bane Description</h2><p>Each bane description includes the following elements.</p><p><strong>Power Level.</strong> This number indicates the required attribute score needed to inflict the bane. If multiple power levels are listed (such as 2 / 4 / 6), then the bane can be inflicted at multiple tiers of power. The <em>Persistent Damage</em> bane, for example, deals increased damage as you inflict it at higher power levels.</p><p><strong>Attack.</strong> This list indicates what type of attack roll to make when inflicting the bane. As long as you possess at least one of the listed attributes at a score greater than or equal to the Power Level, then you can inflict the bane. Each entry consists of an attribute that the attacking player should roll and the defense score targeted by the attack. If the attacker’s roll equals or exceeds the target’s defense score, then the bane is inflicted.</p><p><strong>Duration.</strong> A bane typically remains in effect until the target resists it with a <em>Resist</em> roll, hence most banes have</p><div class="footnote">CHAPTER 6: BANES &amp; BOONS</div><p>a duration of “resist ends”. If a target fails three resist rolls against a bane, the bane can no longer be resisted.

If multiple power levels are listed (such as 2 / 4 / 6), then the boon can be invoked at multiple tiers of power. The <em>Heal</em> boon, for example, heals more damage as you invoke it at higher power levels. The power level of a boon also determines the Challenge Rating of the attribute roll to invoke the boon. The CR equals 10 + 2 x Power Level.</p><p><strong>Attributes.</strong> This is a list of the attribute or attributes that can be used to invoke the boon. As long as you possess at least one of the listed attributes at a score greater than or equal to the Power Level, then you can invoke the boon.</p><p><strong>Invocation Time.</strong> The required time that it takes to invoke the boon. Most boons have an invocation time of 1 major action. For boons that have a longer time, you must spend the entire invocation time concentrating on nothing other than invoking the boon. If you are interrupted, you must start the casting over.</p><p><strong>Duration.</strong> Most boons have a duration of “sustain persists”, which indicates that the invoker must use a sustain action every round in order to keep the boon in effect. If you have a boon in effect and don’t sustain it, the boon’s effects cease at the end of your turn. Because sustaining a boon is a minor action, which can only be taken once per turn, you can typically sustain only one boon at a time.</p><p><strong>Description.</strong> This entry simply provides a general idea of what the boon could look like in the story.</p><p><strong>Effect.</strong> This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the boon on the rules of the game.</p><p><br></p><h2 id="banes-list">Banes List</h2><hr><h3 id="blinded">Blinded</h3><div class="bane-boon-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Duration:</strong> Resist ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)</li><li><strong>Invocation Time:</strong> 1 Major Action</li><li><strong>Power Level:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Attack:</strong></li><li>Agility vs. Guard</li><li>Creation vs. Guard</li><li>Energy vs. Guard</li><li>Entropy vs. Toughness</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You blind your foe with anything from a massive explosion, to a handful of sand, to an arctic blast, to a dazzling flash of light.

Damaging attacks that trigger banes cannot trigger this bane. The charmed bane manifests at two levels: minor and major.</li></ul><p><strong>Minor Charm</strong> - The target is mentally compelled to become more friendly, only changing their attitude toward you moderately. If they are about to strike you, they will restrain themselves - still angry and hostile, but no longer violent. If they want to help you and are leaning toward trusting you, but have some hesitation because you’ve just met, then that hesitation goes away.</p><p><strong>Major Charm</strong> - The attacker chooses whether the major charm is platonic or romantic. If platonic, the bane causes the target to consider the attacker their best friend and one of the most trustworthy and noble people they have met in all their lives. Alternatively, the attacker can choose for this trust and admiration to manifest as romantic love. The target is unable to do anything to plot against the one who afflicted them, and will (at the earliest possible opportunity) tell their charmer of any rumored harm or danger coming their way. The afflicted character becomes immediately suspicious of anyone who speaks ill of their attacker.</p><p>The target is mentally compelled to like and trust you more, depending on the power level of the bane when invoked.</p><ul><li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can Minor Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.</li><li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - You can Minor Charm creatures of humanoid intelligence.

Unlike the charmed bane, characters under the effect of domination lose control of their actions. Their minds, however, struggle to regain control of their own body. They cannot take actions of any kind (except thought) unless it is ordered by you. Every action which the attacker orders the afflicted character to perform which is in extreme violation of their nature gives the target a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. The attacker does not gain special access to the target’s mind and so can only order the character to perform actions that they think or know that the character is capable of. Lastly, each mental order that the attacker gives to the target is a major action. However, the order can be a series of verbal commands, such “Attack enemy X unless someone comes through the door, in which case flee.”. The dominated creature will continue to obey the last mental command they were given until you give a new command.

This instance of the slowed bane cannot be resisted as normal. It persists until the fatigue is removed.</li><li><strong>Level 3</strong> - The target has disadvantage 1 on all attack rolls.</li><li><strong>Level 4</strong> - The target loses their attribute bonuses to their defense scores (Agility and Might for Guard, Fortitude and Will for Toughness, Will and Presence for Resolve). They retain any armor, extraordinary, or feat bonuses.</li><li><strong>Level 5</strong> - The target loses consciousness and is helpless. Being forced into a state of rest, one level of fatigue will be removed automatically after 24 hours, unless circumstances prevent the target from resting peacefully.</li><li><strong>Level 6</strong> - The target dies.</li><li><p><strong>Special:</strong> Unlike other banes, canceling this bane takes time and rest. Each 24 hour period of rest with little or no exertion removes one level of fatigue. If the restoration boon is invoked, the character invoking it can remove one level of Fatigue (in addition to that removed by natural rest) if their attribute used to invoke restoration is between 1 and 6. A target cannot benefit from another invocation of the restoration boon until 24 hours have passed. If the restoration boon’s invoker has an attribute score of 7 or greater, all levels of fatigue are removed instead of just one.</p></li></ul><h3 id="fear">Fear</h3><div class="bane-boon-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Duration:</strong> Special</li><li><strong>Invocation Time:</strong> 1 Major Action</li><li><strong>Power Level:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Attack:</strong></li><li>Creation vs. Resolve</li><li>Entropy vs. Resolve</li><li>Influence vs. Resolve</li><li>Might vs. Resolve</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Through an overwhelming force of physical might or extraordinary power, you strike terror into the hearts of enemies, causing them to flee from your presence.

While the phantasm persists, you can make logical changes to it freely. For example, an illusory person can speak naturally as you direct it and could be made to fall in response to an attack. However, substantial changes to the illusion (such as transforming a human into a goblin) require a new invocation of the illusion.</li><li><strong>Special:</strong> Unlike other banes, this bane does not work by targeting specific enemies. Instead, your Influence roll for invoking it is compared with the Resolve defense of each character that would perceive the created effect if it were real. If the roll is lower than their Resolve, they perceive none of the phantasm’s effects. If the roll is greater than or equal to their Resolve, they perceive the illusory effect you create and react as if it were real.</li></ul><p>When mimicking a very specific person, place, or thing that the target is very familiar with, the GM should consider increasing the target’s Resolve defense for the purpose of that particular phantasm invocation.</p><p>Characters convinced by the phantasm can roll Resist as normal in order to attempt to shake off the bane. If successful, they are no longer deceived by the effect. In addition, you must spend a minor action to sustain the bane during each of your turns.

Polymorph might be accomplished by a druid’s curse, a mad scientist’s transmogrification ray, or exposure to alien radiation.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> Your power level determines the extent to which you can transform your target, as follows. If the target is nto a different creature, it uses the Might, Agility, Fortitude, and Perception attribute scores of the new creature.</li><li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature of the same size. This effect can reduce the target’s attribute scores by up to 2. If the new form would have higher attributes, the target becomes an exceptional version of that creature. For example, transforming a deadly sniper with Agility 5 into a clumsy ogre with Agility 0, would leave the target with an Agility of 3 instead of the 0 typical for the new form.</li></ul><div class="bane-boon-entry" style="margin-top: -0.8em;"></div><hr><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature between double and half its size.

Alternatively, transform the target into an object of its original size. This effect can reduce the target’s attribute scores by up to 5.</li><li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Polymorph a creature into another creature of any size. Alternatively, transform the target into an object of its original size. This effect can reduce the target’s attribute scores by up to 7.</li></ul><p>In order to keep track of hit points, the target should record the total damage they have suffered. When transforming, damage remains with the character even if their maximum hit points change. For example, Agent Walker has a max HP of 20 but is turned into a sheep and has her Fortitude reduced by 2, leaving her at 16 hit points. During combat, she suffers 10 damage. When she later transforms back into Agent Walker, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from her new maximum, leaving her with 10 out of 20 hit points. Additionally, if the shift would reduce the target’s hit points to less than 1, the target’s hit point total becomes 1 instead.</p><h3 id="provoked">Provoked</h3><div class="bane-boon-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Duration:</strong> Resist (minor) ends (Fail x 3 = 1 minute)</li><li><strong>Invocation Time:</strong> 1 Minor Action</li><li><strong>Power Level:</strong> 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 9</li><li><strong>Attack:</strong></li><li>Agility vs. Resolve</li><li>Creation vs. Resolve</li><li>Deception vs. Resolve</li><li>Energy vs. Resolve</li><li>Influence vs. Resolve</li><li>Might vs. Resolve</li><li>Persuasion vs. Resolve</li><li>Presence vs. Resolve</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> Through a display of awe-inspiring force, intimidation, or leadership, you command attention as the greatest threat, causing others to fear attacking your allies.

Anyone within the targeted area who has a Resolve defense score higher than your Prescience action roll to invoke this bane becomes aware of an unseen presence in the area (regardless of whether or not you succeed at the roll).

Being stupefied causes a target to be lulled into a false sense of security, tranquility, and pacifism.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> The target is in a state of mental fog, lowering their mental defenses. While stupefied, the target’s Resolve defense is reduced to 10. In addition, the target has the approximate intelligence of a child. If attacked, it will defend itself until the attack ceases using its natural weapons, but the target will never employ any kind of complex tactic or ability, such as spellcasting. If the target sees fire, it will run away. If it feels pain, it will flee.</li><li><strong>Special:</strong> While most banes last until the target actively attempts to resist it, this bane prevents the target from actively attempting to break free. However, the target’s true mind fights to regain control. As such, at the end of each of its turns, the target receives a resist roll as a free action to break free from the effect. Any attack that causes the target mental or physical pain gives the target an additional resist roll to break free from the bane. Also any action that would startle a wild animal (being hit with a rock, slapped on the face, etc.) will also trigger a free resist roll for the target. Unlike other resist rolls, those triggered by damage, fear, and trauma do not count against the target’s typically allowed failures of 3, beyond which the duration of the bane would extend. When your target succeeds at a resist roll against this bane, they become immune to all subsequent attempts by you to inflict the bane for the next 24 hours.</li></ul><h3 id="truthfulness">Truthfulness</h3><div class="bane-boon-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes (special)</li><li><strong>Invocation Time:</strong> 10 Minutes</li><li><strong>Power Level:</strong> 5</li><li><strong>Attack:</strong></li><li>Influence vs. Resolve</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> By controlling the target’s mind through compulsion magic, chemical injection, neural probes, or similar means, you render them incapable of lying deliberately.

It might be a living creature, an undead fiend, a sentient construct, or any similar creation possessing lifelike properties. Examples of this boon in play include a necromancer creating an undead bodyguard, a mad scientist forging a subhuman being from body parts collected from a variety of corpses, and an engineer creating a cyborg from parts collected at a scrap yard.</li><li><strong>Effect:</strong> You are able to create an autonomous being from inanimate material components, such as dirt, bones, water, vines, scrap metal, or sand (the materials used are subject to the GM’s discretion). To do so, you must first spend 8 hours completing a ritual, experiment, or similar manufacturing process. After this process is complete, make an action roll to invoke this boon. If successful, the inanimate form is permanently imbued with sentience.</li><li>Your ability to animate a creature does not grant you the permanent ability to control it. However, newly animated beings are affected by the charmed bane (see below), and thus treat you more favorably immediately following their creation.

Darkness emanates from the target to a radius equal to five feet per power level of the boon. The effect cancels the effect of all natural light within its radius of effect and creatures that depend on light for vision suffer as though they have the blinded bane while in the area of effect. Creatures that do not depend on light for their vision (if they have tremorsense, blindsight, etc.) are unaffected.

Common examples of this boon include a paladin detecting a suspect’s true intentions, a psychic reading the aura of a location, and a cyborg scanning terrain for signs of life.</li><li><p><strong>Effect:</strong> When calling on this boon, you must choose the type of aura you are detecting: <strong>holy</strong>, <strong>unholy</strong>, <strong>life</strong>, <strong>death</strong>, or <strong>magic</strong>. You can perceive invisible auras pertaining to the chosen type of force and have an approximate sense of their strength (from weak to overwhelming). These auras are usually based on an action that is deliberate, so an otherwise kind shopkeeper would radiate an aura of death for a time after poisoning or killing someone. Even a paladin slaying an evil archmage will give off a radius of death for a time after the killing blow.</p></li><li><strong>Holy</strong> - Holy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the heavens or similar good-aligned dimensions where pure goodness is embodied.</li><li><strong>Unholy</strong> - Unholy energy surrounds extraplanar beings from the hells or similar evil-aligned dimensions where pure evil is embodied.</li><li><strong>Life</strong> - Beings from heavenly dimensions, far-future regenerative nanotech, and clerics wielding the power of healing or protection radiate an aura of life for a time after wielding such capabilities.</li><li><strong>Death</strong> - Necromancers, undead, and murderers all radiate an aura of death. For undead, the aura is constant, since the power of death and magic is what animates them.</li><li><p><strong>Magic</strong> - Extraordinary auras surround objects or places imbued with such effects. Extraordinary creatures who are innately magical, such as a nymph, constantly radiate magic. Natural creatures who wield magic, such as a human wizard, give off an aura only following use of their power.</p></li><li><p><strong>Special:</strong> Unlike other boons, this boon cannot target another character.

It must possess similar physiology to the target, so humanoids and animals are both mammals and therefore can be shifted between. However animals, dragons, plants, elementals, and oozes all have different physiologies, so they cannot be shifted between. The target does not gain alternate forms of movement (flight, swimming, climbing, burrowing, etc.). The target does not gain extraordinary attributes of the new form (hence, they cannot inflict banes that rely on the creature’s extraordinary attributes).</li><li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature between half and double the target’s original size. Gain any non-flight movement modes of the new form.</li><li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature between one quarter and quadruple the target’s original size.</li><li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - Gain the flying movement mode of the new form, if applicable.</li><li><strong>Power Level 6</strong> - Shapeshift into a living creature of a different physiology, such as an elemental, ooze, or a plant.</li><li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - Gain all extraordinary attributes possessed by the target. If both forms have an Alteration attribute, the target chooses between the two scores.</li><li><p><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature of any size.</p></li><li><p><strong>Special:</strong> Shapeshifting into a specific creature (attempting to impersonate them) requires a Deception action roll which is opposed by Perception attribute of anyone who sees the shapeshifted creature. In addition, at power levels 4 and lower, the target does not gain mastery over any special movement modes granted by the new form. As such, the movement speed is cut in half for movement modes not native to the original form, and the GM may rule that certain actions, such as swimming in combat, suffer disadvantage on relevant action rolls.</p></li></ul><h3 id="summon-creature">Summon Creature</h3><div class="bane-boon-entry"></div><hr><ul><li><strong>Duration:</strong> Sustain Persists</li><li><strong>Invocation Time:</strong> 1 Focus Action</li><li><strong>Power Level:</strong> 4 / 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 9</li><li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Alteration, Creation, Entropy, Energy</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> You summon forth a creature to assist your cause, whether they are animals called from the wild, undead minions built from the remains of your foes, or worker bots constructed of spare parts from a salvage yard.
