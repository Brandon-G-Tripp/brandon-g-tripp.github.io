Feats are used to define your character’s specializations, the actions, tasks, and abilities she excels at beyond all others. Some feats will enhance your normal actions, such as by allowing you to multi-attack with reduced disadvantage, while others will grant you completely new powers, such as the ability to change your shape.</p><h2 id="acquiring-feats">Acquiring Feats</h2><p>As described in Chapter 1, feats are purchased using feat points. Your character begins with 6 feat points at first level and gains 3 additional feat points at each new level beyond first. You do not have to spend all of your feat points during character creation or upon leveling up. You can save any unused feat points to be used at a later time.</p><h2 id="reading-a-feat-description">Reading a Feat Description</h2><p>The full listing of feats is available in a searchable list <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats">here</a>.</p><p>Each feat description includes the following elements.</p><p><strong>Title.</strong> The name of the feat. Some feats contain multiple tiers, rising in power with each new tier. If a feat contains multiple tiers, these will be indicated in parentheses after the title (e.g., “Alternate Form (I - III)” ).</p><p><strong>Cost.</strong> This is the number of feat points required to purchase the feat. If the feat has multiple tiers, the cost is the same for each tier and must be paid every time the feat is purchased at a new tier.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites.</strong> Many feats have specific requirements that must be met before a character can purchase the feat. Prerequisites may take the form of a minimum attribute score, another feat, or a special requirement. If a feat has multiple tiers with different prerequisites, the requirements for each tier are separated by a slash.</p><p><strong>Description.</strong> This entry simply provides a general idea of what the feat could look like in the story.</p><p><strong>Effect.</strong> This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the feat on the rules of the game.</p>')}])}}});
