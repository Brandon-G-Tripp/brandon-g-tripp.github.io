In this chapter, you’ll learn all the rules for fighting strategic and epic battles.</p><h2 id="when-combat-ensues">When Combat Ensues</h2><p>The first thing to realize is that not every instance of violence or fighting in your game needs to be broken down into blow-by-blow, round-by-round narration. The outcome of a simple bar fight, which might be important to the story but not particularly fun to play through, could be decided using a few action rolls based around the core mechanic explained in Chapter 2. A final showdown with an evil necromancer fought upon air ships sailing through the clouds, on the other hand, is epic and fun enough to merit a blow-by-blow resolution. The GM is the final arbiter who decides when to start combat, and they can do so with three simple words: “Roll for initiative!”.</p><h2 id="starting-combat">Starting Combat</h2><p>When the GM declares that combat will begin, the game is separated into rounds. Each round represents about six seconds of time in game, and during a round, each PC and each GM-controlled monster or NPC will receive one turn. Before combat begins, there are two things that must be done: determining surprise and rolling for initiative.</p><h3 id="determining-surprise">Determining Surprise</h3><p>In any combat, one or more combatants may be surprised if their enemy catches them off guard or unaware. For example, if a pack of bandits lays an ambush for the PCs in a rocky chasm, the GM may have every member of the party make a Perception roll contested by the bandits’ Agility roll. Any PC who fails the check is surprised. The GM decides when some or all combatants may be surprised.</p><p>Surprised characters always act after non-surprised characters, as explained in the rules for initiative. Furthermore, until a surprised character takes their first turn, they may not take any interrupt actions and all attacks made against them gain advantage 1.</p><h3 id="roll-for-initiative">Roll for Initiative</h3><p>After surprise has been determined, each combatant makes an Agility action roll. The total of a combatant’s Agility roll is their initiative score. The GM may decide to make one roll for each group of monsters instead of tracking every monster’s initiative individually.</p><p>Write down all initiative scores from highest to lowest. When taking turns in combat, characters act in order from highest initiative score to lowest.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If any character is wielding a weapon with the <em>swift</em> property at the beginning of combat, they gain advantage on their initiative roll equal to the weapon’s <em>swift</em> value (i.e., <em>swift</em> 2 provides advantage 2). A character may also gain this benefit even if they are not wielding the weapon at the beginning of combat, but in doing so they commit themselves to drawing the weapon on their first turn.</p><p>If any characters are surprised, keep two initiative orders: one for surprised combatants and one for non-surprised ones. All characters in the non-surprised order act first, after which characters in the surprised order act.</p><blockquote><h4 id="example-of-initiative-and-surprise">Example of Initiative and Surprise</h4><p>Spaz and Jalani are exploring the crash site of an Armada Star Cruiser for salvage when they are ambushed by a pack of Mugworm Griblicks.</p><p>Spaz and Jalani roll Agility checks to determine initiative, and the GM makes one roll for the Griblicks as a group. Jalani announces that she’ll be drawing her Las Pistol, which has the <em>swift 1</em> property, granting her advantage 1 on her Agility roll. Spaz was rummaging through a closet at the moment of attack, so the GM rules that he is surprised.</p><blockquote><p>Spaz (Agility 2) rolls 1d20 + 1d6, and gets a 14.</p><p>Jalani (Agility 4) rolls 1d20 + 2d10 (keeping the highest d10), and gets a 25.</p><p>The Griblicks (Agility 3) roll 1d20 + 1d8, and get an 11.</p></blockquote><p>The final initiative order is as follows:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Non-surprised Combatants</strong></p><p>Jalani 25 (On her first turn, she must draw her Las Pistol)</p><p>Griblicks 11</p><p><strong>Surprised Combatants</strong></p><p>Spaz 14</p></blockquote></blockquote><h2 id="the-core-mechanic-in-combat">The Core Mechanic in Combat</h2><p>The core mechanic of <em>Open Legend</em> is meant to inspire creativity in players and GMs so that the story always moves forward and so that no dice roll ever feels wasted. However, in combat, players typically make many more action rolls than usual, so the GM may feel overwhelmed if they are constantly trying to come up with new interpretations of a failed roll on the fly.</p><p>Some GMs might love that kind of challenge, and for them, <strong>the core mechanic can be used in combat in the same way it is in every other part of the game</strong>. GMs who want something a little more streamlined <strong>may use the following modification</strong> to the usual core mechanic in combat:</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table style="width:3%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>The Action Roll for Attacks<br>Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="width:8%;"><colgroup><col width="4%"><col width="4%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="left">If the action roll…</th><th align="left">then the result is…</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="left">equals or exceeds the Challenge Rating,</td><td align="left">the player succeeds.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="left">is less than the Challenge Rating,</td><td align="left">The GM and the PC both choose 1:<br>-<br>Deal 3 damage<br>Inflict 1 bane of Power Level &lt;= 3<br>Move 10’ w/o opportunity attacks</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With these modified rules, a player’s failed attack roll means that the player may not get what they were aiming for, but they get something. And it comes at a cost because the GM also gets to choose an effect. Remember, also, that the rules for interpreting a failed roll only apply to PCs. For the GM, a success is a success and a failure is a failure (See chapter 2 for more details).</p><blockquote><h3 id="example-of-the-core-mechanic-in-combat">Example of the Core Mechanic in Combat</h3><p>Vera hurls herself at the red dragon attempting to cut through his scaly hide. However, her attack roll fails to hit the dragon’s evasion of 25. She chooses to inflict 3 damage, but the GM also gets a choice.</p><p>He chooses to inflict the knockdown bane: The dragon’s tail lashes around and sweeps Vera to the floor.</p></blockquote><h3 id="why-succeed-on-a-failed-roll">Why Succeed on a Failed Roll?</h3><p>Some players might wonder why a PC still gets a taste of success even when their roll fails to meet the Challenge Rating. This might seem unrealistic because in movies and novels, for example, sometimes the bullet just misses or the sword fails to connect. In Open Legend, the “success with a twist” rules for combat ensure that a fight never gets stagnant. Even when the dice go against the player, the battle still builds to a cinematic conclusion as combatants shift around the battlefield and wear away at each other’s reserves. Hit points represent more than just physical endurance and missing a target’s defense score can mean more than just a shot going wide. Even if a hail of gunfire fails to penetrate an enemy’s body armor, it might still weaken their resolve (<em>deal 3 damage</em>), force them to take cover (<em>inflict knockdown</em>), or give the attacker an opportunity to gain ground (<em>move 10’</em>).</p><h2 id="using-attributes-to-inflict-damage">Using Attributes to Inflict Damage</h2><p>Combat in <em>Open Legend</em> is a swirl of action rolls as blades clash, traps spring, lightning forks, and arrows fly. However, because of the free-form nature of storytelling in <em>Open Legend</em>, you may not always know what attributes can be used to make attacks.</p><h3 id="always">Always</h3><p>Some attributes can pretty much always be used to deal damage. These include Might, Agility, Energy, and Entropy. These are the standards for swinging mauls, slinging arrows, raining fire, draining life force, and so on.</p><h3 id="sometimes">Sometimes</h3><p>A few attributes can be used for damaging attacks in special circumstances in which the story dictates that the damage arises from your skill in the attribute. These include Logic, Protection, Alteration, Influence, and Movement. Though the occasions to use these attributes for damage will be rare, as long as the story makes sense, combatants should be able to damage foes with them. Examples of situations in which these attributes might be used in an action roll for a damaging attack are provided below.</p><p><strong>Logic.</strong> Springing a trap on your foes.</p><p><strong>Protection.</strong> Shielding yourself with a wall of magical knives.</p><p><strong>Alteration.</strong> Causing a tree branch to strangle a foe.</p><p><strong>Influence.</strong> For illusory effects that are convincing enough, any number could mimic damage until your enemy is aware of the trick. For mental compulsion, forcing a dominated enemy to stab himself.</p><p><strong>Movement.</strong> Using telekinesis to hurl a boulder at a foe.</p><h3 id="probably-never">Probably Never</h3><p>The remaining attributes don’t really lend themselves to damage. Without a VERY good explanation, the following cannot be used for damaging attacks: fortitude, learning, perception, will, deception, persuasion, presence, creation, prescience.</p><h2 id="taking-your-turn">Taking Your Turn</h2><p>When your turn in the initiative order comes, you are allowed one major action, one move action, and any number of minor actions (though you may not take more than one minor action of the same type). In lieu of taking any of these actions, you may choose to take one focus action on your turn.</p><table style="width:8%;"><colgroup><col width="4%"><col width="4%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="left">On your turn, you may take…</th><th align="left">Or…</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="left">1 Major Action*<br>1 Move Action<br>Any number of minor actions</td><td align="left">1 Focus Action</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Major action may be traded for a move action</em></p><h3 id="major-actions">Major Actions</h3><p>Major actions are what you take to get big things done in combat.

Every attack is either physical or extraordinary. Physical attacks typically involve weapons, claws, teeth, or other natural means of inflicting damage that rely on the attacker’s Might or Agility attribute. Extraordinary attacks are those that make use of one of the attacker’s extraordinary attributes, such as by using Energy to summon a ball of fire. A character can only make an extraordinary attack if they possess a score of 1 or higher in the relevant attribute.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table style="width:3%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>The Action Roll for Attacks<br>Roll 1d20 + attribute dice (all dice explode)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-head"></div><table style="width:6%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Step 1: Determine Range</strong></td><td><strong>Melee</strong> = Within your reach<br><strong>Projectile</strong> = Weapon range (Disadvantage 1 per extra range increment)<br><strong>Extraordinary</strong><br>1 - 3 = 25’<br>4 - 6 = 50’<br>7 - 9 = 75’</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Step 2: Determine Targets</strong></td><td><em>If more than one target…</em><br><strong>Melee</strong> = Disadvantage equals total # of targets<br><strong>Ranged</strong> = Disadvantage equals total # of targets (Max 5 targets within 25’ square)<br><strong>Area</strong> = Disadvantage varies (see below)</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Step 3: Determine Targeted Defense</strong></td><td>Weapon Attacks target Evasion<br><br>Extraordinary Attacks target the most logical defense<br><strong>Evasion</strong> if the attack requires dodging or deflection<br><strong>Toughness</strong> if the attack targets bodily health<br><strong>Resolve</strong> if the attack harms the psyche or will</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Step 4: Roll Attack and Calculate Damage</strong></td><td><strong>Damage dealt</strong> = Attack Roll minus Defense<br><br>10 over defense, inflict one bane as well</td></tr></tbody></table><h5 id="determine-range">1.

Determine Targeted Defense</h5><p>Every attack targets one of your foe’s defenses: toughness, evasion, or resolve.</p><p>Weapon attacks always target evasion.</p><p>Extraordinary attacks are more open-ended and often require the GM to decide the type of defense targeted using the following guidelines:</p><ul><li><strong>Toughness</strong> is used to defend against attacks that require bodily endurance, health, or sturdiness, such as poison and necrotic energy.</li><li><strong>Evasion</strong> protects against attacks that can be dodged, deflected, or avoided by taking cover, such as a ball of flame or a magical wall of blades.</li><li><strong>Resolve</strong> guards against mental assaults and deceptions, such as attacks from a phantasmal beast or damage caused by an illusory pit.</li></ul><h5 id="roll-attack-and-calculate-damage">4. Roll Attack and Calculate Damage</h5><p>Make an action roll using the appropriate Attribute to determine the effectiveness of your attack. Forceful weapons use Might while Precise weapons use Agility. Extraordinary attacks use an attribute appropriate to the story (e.g., Energy for a fiery blast, Entropy for a disintegration ray).</p><p>The Challenge Rating for your roll is the target’s defense score. If you succeed, the target takes damage equal to your action roll minus the targeted defense. This damage is subtracted from the target’s hit points.</p><p><strong>Exceptional Success</strong></p><p>If your damaging attack roll exceeds the target’s defense by 10 or more, you may apply one bane of a Power Level less than or equal to the attribute you used for the attack. In order to apply a bane, your attack roll must equal or exceed the appropriate defense for that bane. If your attack targeted multiple foes, you may apply the bane to each qualifying target.</p><h4 id="make-a-bane-attack">Make a Bane Attack</h4><p>Instead of attempting to damage a target, you may instead choose to inflict your enemy with a bane. In order to inflict a bane, you must possess an appropriate attribute of at least the bane’s power level, as detailed in the <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/banes"><em>bane descriptions</em></a>. While targets may be effected by multiple banes, you may not <em>stack</em> banes; a target cannot be inflicted with a bane it is currently suffering from, unless specified in the boon’s effect (<em>e.g.</em> <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/banes/fatigued">Fatigued</a>).</p><p>To resolve a bane attack, follow these steps:</p><h5 id="determine-range-and-targets">1. Determine Range and Target(s)</h5><p>Bane attacks follow the same rules for determining range and number of targets as damaging attacks.</p><h5 id="determine-targeted-defense-1">2. Determine Targeted Defense</h5><p>The targeted defense is determined by the type of bane being inflicted.

Roll Your Attack</h5><p>The <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/banes"><em>bane descriptions</em></a> also indicate which attributes can be used to inflict each bane. Make an action roll using the appropriate attribute. If your total equals or exceeds the target’s defense score, your target suffers the bane.</p><blockquote><h5 id="example-bane-attacks">Example Bane Attacks</h5><p>Setting Sun is heavily wounded and needs a chance to escape from the samurai who is mercilessly pressing the attack. With a well timed snake strike, the monk attempts to blind the armored warrior. Setting Sun is making a melee attack targeting a single foe, so he makes an action roll using his Agility of 5 versus the samurai’s Evasion of 18. The monk rolls 1d20 + 2d6 and scores a 20, so his foe is inflicted with the <em>blinded</em> bane.</p><hr><p>Zarthakis, the great wyrm, is surrounded by a party of 4 adventurers. He unfurls the full fury of his wings and bellows a mighty roar, instilling terror in his foes as he attempts to inflict the Demoralized Bane using his Presence attribute. The dragon’s Presence is 8, giving him a range of 75’, quite enough to target all of the heroes. Because Zarthakis is multi-targeting 4 foes, he has disadvantage 4 on his action roll. Normally, he would roll 1d20 + 3d8, but because he has disadvantage, the wyrm rolls 1d20 + 7d8 (keeping the lowest 3 d8s). His total score is 22, which he compares to each target’s Resolve defense score separately. The heroes have Resolve scores of 14, 17, 22, and 25, so the dragon manages to inflict the bane on three of the four.</p></blockquote><h4 id="invoke-a-boon">Invoke a Boon</h4><p>You can invoke boons in order to aid yourself or allies. In order to invoke a boon, you must possess an appropriate attribute of at least the boon’s power level, as detailed in the <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/boons"><em>boon descriptions</em></a>. To invoke a boon, follow these steps:</p><h5 id="determine-range-and-targets-1">1.

Use the Boon Challenge Rating Table to determine the highest power level at which you can invoke the boon based on your action roll. Regardless of your roll, you cannot invoke a boon at a power level greater than the attribute you are using to invoke the boon.

Jade’s Alteration attribute is 6, but she suffers disadvantage 2 due to multi-targeting. She rolls 1d20 + 4d8 (keeping the lowest 2 d8s) and gets a 20. <em>Invisible</em> is Power Level 6, so Jade falls short of the Challenge Rating of 22. The boon fails to take effect.</p><hr><p>Stitch is attempting to close an ally’s wounds by invoking the <em>Heal</em> boon. His Learning attribute is 5, so he rolls 1d20 + 2d6 and gets a total of 24. According to the Boon Challenge Rating table, Stitch rolled high enough to invoke the boon at power level 7. However, because his Learning attribute is 5, he can only invoke <em>heal</em> at power level 5, allowing him to heal his ally 2d6 hit points according to the boon description.</p></blockquote><h4 id="assist-an-ally">Assist an Ally</h4><p>You can use your major action to assist an ally with an action roll if they are using an attribute you have a score of 1 or greater in. The ally automatically gets advantage 1 on their roll.</p><h4 id="take-an-extra-move-action">Take an Extra Move Action</h4><p>On any turn, instead of taking a major action, you may use an extra move action.</p><h3 id="move-actions">Move Actions</h3><p>Move actions are typically what you take in order to maneuver around the battlefield, though you can also use them for a few other purposes. Move actions may be used to accomplish the following:</p><ul><li>Move your speed</li><li>Take special movement</li><li>Resist banes</li></ul><h4 id="move-your-speed">Move Your Speed</h4><p>You may move up to your speed. The base speed for characters is 30’. This movement may be broken up by other actions. For example, you may move 10 feet, use a minor action to open a door, move 10 more feet, and then use your major action to attack a foe.</p><h4 id="take-special-movement">Take Special Movement</h4><p>Special movement includes climbing, jumping, swimming, and other movement that is typically more restricted than just running across the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Jump</strong>. Make a Might roll. If you can’t get at least a 10’ running start, you have disadvantage 1.</p><ul><li><strong>For a long jump,</strong> you cover a number of feet equal to your roll.</li><li><strong>For a high jump,</strong> you cover a number of feet equal to your roll divided by 2.</li></ul><p><strong>Climb</strong>. You climb at half of your normal speed. The GM may require a Might or Agility check if the situation is particularly dangerous.</p><p><strong>Swim</strong>. You swim at half of your normal speed. The GM may require a Might or Fortitude check if you are swimming a long distance, against a very strong current, or in similarly challenging situations.</p><h4 id="resist-banes">Resist Banes</h4><p>Instead of using your move action to maneuver, you may focus your energy on shaking off the negative effects of any banes currently afflicting you. For each bane affecting you, roll 1d20 (with no attribute modifiers). If your roll is a 10 or higher, the bane is removed. This roll is not considered an action roll, and thus is not affected by advantage or disadvantage.</p><p>Many banes will persist for a longer duration after three failed resist attempts to shake them off. As such, you should keep a tally of any banes which you to fail resist.</p><blockquote><h5 id="example-of-resisting-banes">Example of Resisting Banes</h5><p>After standing toe-to-toe with an Ichor Demon for six rounds, Garcon is afflicted with three banes: <em>persistent damage</em>, <em>slowed</em>, and <em>blinded</em>. He uses his move action to attempt to resist these banes, so he rolls a d20 for each one, getting an 8, 16, and 9, respectively. Therefore, Garcon manages to shake off <em>slowed</em>, but he is still suffering from <em>persistent damage</em> and <em>blinded</em>. He notes on his character sheet that he has failed to resist each of these banes once.</p></blockquote><h3 id="minor-actions">Minor Actions</h3><p>Minor actions are tasks that don’t require much time or effort, but often set up larger actions. You may take any number of minor actions on your turn, but you cannot take more than one of the same type of minor action. Minor actions include the following:</p><ul><li>Draw a weapon</li><li>Retrieve an item stored on your person</li><li>Sustain a boon</li><li>Make a Perception roll to observe your surroundings</li><li>Make a Learning roll to recall useful information</li><li>Open a door, chest, drawer, etc.</li><li>Make an opportunity attack</li></ul><h4 id="opportunity-attacks">Opportunity Attacks</h4><p>An opportunity attack is a special kind of minor action because it does not take place during your turn. If you are wielding a melee weapon, and an enemy moves from a space within your reach to a space that is not within your reach, you may make a free attack against the enemy. (Note that, as a minor action, you may only make one opportunity attack per round).</p><p>Only voluntary movement made on the moving character’s turn trigger opportunity attacks. Movement caused by a foe’s <em>forced move</em> bane or an ally’s <em>telekinesis</em> boon, for example, do not trigger opportunity attacks.</p><blockquote><h5 id="opportunity-attack-examples">Opportunity Attack Examples</h5><p>Tommy has no choice but to flee from the three orcs that have closed upon him. He moves as far as he can to get away from them. However, because he moved from a space adjacent to them into a space not adjacent to them, all three orcs get to make an opportunity attack.</p><hr><p>Vera is toe-to-toe with two snotlings who flee in terror as she enters a berserker rage. Both snotlings trigger an opportunity attack. However, because she is limited to one opportunity attack per round, Vera can only attack one of them.</p><hr><p>Sergeant Rage is wielding a shotgun. A ratman dashes up to him, attacks with a dagger, and then dashes away. Because Sarge doesn’t have a melee weapon equipped, he does not get an opportunity attack against the ratman.</p></blockquote><h4 id="sustaining-boons">Sustaining Boons</h4><p>Many boons have a default duration of <em>sustain persists</em>, which means that every time a character uses the <strong>sustain</strong> action, the boon remains in effect for 1 additional round. If you have a boon in effect and do not sustain it, the boon ends when your turn is over. Because sustaining a boon is a minor action, you can normally only sustain one boon at a time, and you cannot sustain a boon on a round in which you take a focus action.</p><blockquote><h5 id="sustaining-boon-examples">Sustaining Boon Examples</h5><p>Ruby invokes the <em>flight</em> boon and takes to the skies. On her next turn, she wants to keep the <em>flight</em> active, so she uses a minor action to sustain it. An enemy then inflicts her with the <em>stunned</em> boon, limiting her to a single major, move, or minor action. When her turn comes up again, she uses a single move action to reach a safe landing spot. Because she is <em>stunned</em> she does not have a minor action to use to sustain the boon, so it ends when her turn is over.</p><hr><p>Doctor Van Strankenkloff has invoked the <em>darkness</em> boon using his patented Light Sucker Mark IV. On his next turn, under cover of darkness, he activates his Personal Transmogrification Belt to invoke the <em>shapeshift</em> boon to turn into a mouse. Because both boons have a duration of “sustain persists”, and the doctor may only sustain one boon at a time, he chooses to sustain the <em>shapeshift</em>. At the end of his turn, the <em>darkness</em> is dispelled and the <em>shapeshift</em> persists.</p></blockquote><h3 id="focus-actions">Focus Actions</h3><p>Using a focus action involves spending all of your energy and attention on one task. If you choose to forgo your major, move, and minor actions for a round, you may instead take a focus action. Choose one of the following types of focus action:</p><h4 id="disrupting-attack">Disrupting Attack</h4><p>Make a damaging attack using the normal attack rules. If your roll exceeds the target’s defense by 10 or more, then any boons being sustained by your target immediately end.</p><h4 id="superior-action">Superior Action</h4><p>Make any one action roll with advantage 1.</p><h4 id="charge">Charge</h4><p>Move up to twice your speed and make one melee attack at disadvantage 1.</p><h3 id="interrupt-actions">Interrupt Actions</h3><p>In some situations, you may want to take an action in response to another combatant’s action. In these cases, you can use an interrupt action. However, whenever you use an interrupt action, you lose your major action the next time your turn in the initiative order comes up. You can use your interrupt action to attempt any of the following:</p><h4 id="defend">Defend</h4><p>You may use a defend action after an enemy has rolled a successful attack against you or an ally in order to attempt to ward off the attack. (Protection, Agility, and Might are all typical examples of attributes used to defend).</p><p>If your attribute roll is higher than the targeted defense score, then your roll replaces the targeted defense score for that attack only. A single defend action can only be used to defend one target. (<strong>Note:</strong> Characters wielding a shield gain advantage 1 on defend actions when appropriate).</p><p>As part of your defend action, you may also move up to half of your speed at any time during your action. If you are adjacent to your ally when moving, the ally may choose to move with you.</p><blockquote><h5 id="defend-examples">Defend Examples</h5><p>Vera is nearing death when the River Troll lunges at her. The troll rolls a 23 against Vera’s Evasion of 17, so she uses a defend action to catch the troll’s arms before he can rend her to death. Vera makes a Might roll and gets a 20, so her roll replaces her Evasion, causing her to suffer 3 points of damage instead of 6. Because defend is an interrupt action, when Vera’s turn in the initiative comes, she does not get a major action.</p><hr><p>A grenade lands at the feet of Spaz and Tomlinson. The grenade rolls a 25 against their Evasion scores of 12 and 18, potentially dealing 13 and 7 damage, respectively. Tomlinson uses the defend action to move half his speed (15 feet) away, opting to move Spaz with him, and then makes an Agility roll to shield his ally. Tomlinson is wielding a riot shield, so he gets advantage 1 on his Agility roll, which totals 26. Spaz takes no damage. However, since the defend action can only affect a single target, Tomlinson still takes 7 points of damage. Because defend is an interrupt action, when Tomlinson’s turn in the initiative comes, he does not get a major action.</p></blockquote><h4 id="improvise">Improvise</h4><p>You may also use your interrupt action in order to improvise a response to a situation in combat. For example, if an ally falls off a cliff, you may use your interrupt action to invoke a levitate boon and save them. Improvised interrupt actions should generally be limited to non-offensive reactions meant to assist allies.</p><h3 id="free-actions">Free Actions</h3><p>If a feat, perk, boon, or other source grants a <em>Free Action</em>, that action can be performed without counting against the normal limits to your actions per turn.</p><h2 id="damage-and-healing">Damage and Healing</h2><p>Your hit points (HP) are an abstract measure of your character’s ability to ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. Whenever you take damage, your hit points are reduced, and whenever you receive healing they are increased.</p><h3 id="finishing-blows">Finishing Blows</h3><p>When you suffer a damaging attack while unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to defend yourself, the attack counts as a <strong>finishing blow</strong> and may cause immediate death. Your defense against a finishing blow does not include your Fortitude or Agility attributes. Furthermore, if a finishing blow deals any damage, you must make a Fortitude roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 plus the damage dealt. If you fail this roll, you are dead.</p><h3 id="reaching-zero-hit-points">Reaching Zero Hit Points</h3><p>When you reach zero HP, you fall unconscious. Your hit points cannot be reduced below zero. While unconscious, you are helpless and any attack made against you counts as a finishing blow. Any healing that you receive to bring your hit points above zero also causes you to regain consciousness.</p><h3 id="healing-after-combat">Healing After Combat</h3><p>After a combat encounter ends and you have at least ten minutes to rest and catch your breath, your hit points return to their maximum if you are already conscious. If you are unconscious, you regain consciousness and all hit points after 2d4 hours.</p><h3 id="lethal-damage">Lethal Damage</h3><p>Lethal damage is used sparingly in Open Legend as a way for GMs to paint a picture of injury consequences over time. This is especially helpful for grim and gritty storylines where effects of injury should extend beyond a combat encounter. A GM might incorporate a trap or environmental hazard that deals lethal damage. Since these situations occur outside of combat, normal damage would othewise have no long term effect on the story.</p><p>A creature’s maximum hit point toal is reduced by the amount of lethal damage it has sustained. The maximum lethal damage a creature can accrue is equal to it’s maximum hit points. If a creature sustains lethal damage greater than or equal to it’s maximum hit point total, the creature is unconscious until it heals at least 1 hit point of lethal damage.</p><p>Lethal damage is more difficult to heal then regular damage, healing at a rate of 1 hit point per day per Fortitude attribute point (minimum of 1 hit point). With the full-time attendance of a capable healer or doctor, any number of characters who are located in the same area and avoid strenuous activity heal at an additional rate equal to their attendant’s Creation, Presence, or Learning score. Multiple attendants do not cumulatively improve this accelerated healing rate (the bonus is simply equal to the highest score among attendants).</p><p>For example, a warrior with Fortitude 4 heals 4 lethal damage per day on their own. With the assistance of a physician with a learning score of 8, the same warrior would heal at a rate of 12 lethal damage per day.</p><blockquote><h3 id="critical-hits-optional-rule">Critical Hits (Optional Rule)</h3><p>To add a more gritty realism to injuries</p><p>Whenever you roll a natural 20 on the d20 used in a damaging attack roll, your attack inflicts some lethal damage. The amount of lethal damage is equal to the total of subsequent d20 rolls for that attack (i.e., the d20 explosion total), with a maximum equal to the damage dealt by the attack.</p></blockquote>');
