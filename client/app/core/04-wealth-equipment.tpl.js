Indiana Jones had his whip, King Arthur had <em>Excalibur</em>, and Bilbo had his mithril shirt. In this chapter, you’ll learn everything you need to know about how to equip your character at first level and beyond, as well as how to keep track of your wealth as you capture dragon hoards and seize kingdoms.</p><h2 id="wealth">Wealth</h2><p>Rather than tracking every gold piece, gem, and fine art object that you acquire over the course of your adventures, Open Legend uses a simplified wealth system.</p><p>Every character has a Wealth Score, which begins at 2 and can range from 0 to 9, fluctuating up and down as you acquire and spend your riches. Your wealth score provides a general description of how well-off you are and the typical types of goods and services you can acquire. The Wealth Overview table describes the typical lifestyles and available goods for each Wealth Score.</p><h3 id="acquiring-goods-and-services">Acquiring Goods and Services</h3><p>When you are trying to buy new equipment, construct an inn, or hire a craftsman, your wealth score determines whether you are able. Every good or service is assigned a Wealth Level (either in the rules or by the GM). This level is compared with your Wealth Score in order to determine the cost of acquiring the item, as follows:</p><p>If the good you want to purchase has a level lower than your Wealth Score, you can acquire the item easily without taxing your time and resources.</p><p>If the item’s level is <strong>equal to</strong> your Wealth Score, you can acquire it, but the expense taxes your resources such that you cannot acquire new goods at that level or higher for two weeks.</p><p>If the object of your purchase is <strong>one level higher than</strong> your Wealth Score and your wealth score is above 0, you can acquire it, but the cost is so great that your Wealth Score is reduced by 1.</p><p>You cannot make purchases that are more than one level higher than your Wealth Score.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Wealth Overview</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="width:25%;"><colgroup><col width="5%"><col width="9%"><col width="9%"></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th align="center">Wealth Score</th><th align="left">Sample Lifestyles</th><th align="left">Sample Goods</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center">0</td><td align="left">beggar, street urchin</td><td align="left">3 square meals and a warm bed</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">1</td><td align="left">unskilled laborer</td><td align="left">a night on the town, leather armor, simple weapons</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">2</td><td align="left">skilled laborer, town guardsman, 1st level hero</td><td align="left">martial weapons, scale mail armor, a good horse, a raft</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">3</td><td align="left">master artisan, village mayor</td><td align="left">full plate armor, silver weapons, a small boat, a fine horse</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">4</td><td align="left">4th level hero, noble, city mayor</td><td align="left">elven full plate, a small ship, a siege engine</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">5</td><td align="left">lord of a realm, thieves’ guild master in a large city</td><td align="left">a large cargo ship, a city wall</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">6</td><td align="left">7th level hero</td><td align="left">a large warship</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">7</td><td align="left">king</td><td align="left">a stronghold, startup funding for a new town</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">8</td><td align="left">10th level hero</td><td align="left">startup funding for a new city, an army of 10,000</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">9</td><td align="left">emperor</td><td align="left">a castle, an army of 50,000</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><h4 id="examples-of-acquiring-goods-and-services">Examples of Acquiring Goods and Services</h4><p>Thanks to a recently successful salvage run, Shara’s wealth just increased to 4. She’s had her eyes set on a new cargo ship for a while now, which the GM has set at wealth level 5. Shara chooses to spend her savings to get the ship. Because it is one level higher than her current wealth score, her wealth is permanently reduced by 1, leaving her with a wealth score of 3.</p><hr><p>Slade, master of the local thieves’ guild, has a wealth score of 5. He wants to outfit all of his men with new weapons, which the GM has decided requires wealth level 5. Slade can complete the purchase, but it is so taxing on his resources that for the next two weeks he can only acquire goods that are below his wealth score.</p><hr><p>Crazy Mac has panhandled his way up to a wealth score of 1. From now on, he can afford 3 square meals and a warm bed every night, because they are priced at wealth level 0.</p></blockquote><p><strong>The Rule of Common Sense</strong>. Your Wealth Score determines which purchases are possible given the proper circumstances. Obviously, if you are in the middle of a desert, you can’t buy a keg of water even if you have the wealth of an emperor. Likewise, even though you have enough money to raise an army, the GM may rule that you still require the appropriate amount of time, effort, and charisma to convince the soldiers to follow you.</p><h3 id="gaining-wealth">Gaining Wealth</h3><p>As you adventure throughout the realm, slay mythic beasts, and win over affluent nobles, your wealth will increase. The GM decides when a character’s wealth increases, and the Wealth Overview table provides a few milestones of typical character Wealth Scores at different levels.</p><p>Typical situations of when the GM would grant you an increase in your Wealth Score include acquiring a large hoard from a monster’s lair, finding a buyer for a great and powerful magical item, or being rewarded by a great ruler.</p><h2 id="carrying-capacity">Carrying Capacity</h2><p><em>Open Legend</em> is about rolling dice, telling epic stories, and having a good time. So the rules for determining how much you can carry are purposefully simplified so that you and your friends can spend your time on what matters: the game.</p><h3 id="twenty-items-max">Twenty Items Max</h3><p>You can carry up to twenty pieces of gear. No more. Only track the items that will actually affect the game. So, no, you don’t need to record your pants and shirt on your character sheet. But, your armor does count.</p><p>Multiple items of a similar nature that can be stowed together, such as twenty arrows in a quiver or a belt of healing potions, only count as a single item. The GM can use their own discretion to apply common sense limits if necessary. For example, even though technically 1000 clips of ammo would count as a single item, the GM is free to rule that a PC can’t carry them or that they would count as a <em>bulky</em> item (see below).</p><h3 id="maximum-heavy-items-equals-might-score">Maximum <em>Heavy</em> Items Equals Might Score</h3><p>Some items have the <em>heavy</em> property. You can carry a number of <em>heavy</em> items equal to your Might score. Once you’re carrying your maximum number of <em>heavy</em> items, your speed is cut in half. A character with a zero Might score cannot carry any heavy items.</p><h3 id="one-maybe-two-bulky-items">One (Maybe Two) <em>Bulky</em> Items</h3><p>Some items have the <em>bulky</em> property. You can carry one <em>bulky</em> item at no penalty. You can carry a second <em>bulky</em> item, but your speed is reduced to 5’.</p><h2 id="weapons-implements">Weapons &amp; Implements</h2><p>In this section you will find the tools needed to pick weapons and armor that your character will use in battle. The first half is a simplified weapon and armor creation table that can help to guide you to the right choice that makes the most sense for your Character. The second half is a more complex area for making more specific weapons.</p><p><em>Open Legend does not insist that every weapon be equal in terms of the mechanical benefits in using it, thus some weapons will be seen more often, since they offer more advantages to the wielder than other weapons.</em></p><p><strong>Examples</strong> are a few weapons or armor that could reflect this category. It is not an exhaustive list by any means, but simply something to get your brain working. Feel free to discuss with your GM about other items that would make sense.</p><p><strong>Category</strong> is the general group that the weapon falls into. Some weapons may fall into multiple categories. If a weapon falls into multiple categories, for each attack, the wielder must choose the mode being used and the attack gains the benefits of that category. For example a dagger is both “Close Ranged” and “One-handed Melee”. On each attack, the wielder chooses the mode.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Melee</strong> - weapons in this category are meant for close quarters hand-to-hand combat.</p><ul><li><strong>One-handed Melee</strong> - The weapon uses a single hand and allows the other hand to be used for carrying another object, second weapon, or kept free for other actions. When wielding a one-handed weapon in each hand, you gain advantage 1 to all melee attacks; with two weapons, you have a better chance of capitalizing on openings in your target’s defense. If both weapons you are wielding have passive benefits such as the Deadly or Defensive properties, your benefit is the best of the two but does not stack.</li><li><strong>Two-Handed Melee</strong> - The weapon requires two hands to wield and cannot be used with a shield or other weapon. Two-handed melee weapons grant advantage 1 to all attacks; blows delivered with both hands are usually more deadly.</li><li><strong>Versatile Melee</strong> - The weapon can be wielded either one-handed or two-handed. The wielder can freely switch between the two modes and has all of the benefits and restrictions of whichever mode they are using.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ranged</strong> - Weapons in this category can be used to make ranged attacks with no penalty up to their range increment (in feet). Attacks made up to twice the normal range suffer disadvantage 1, and attacks made up to three times the normal range suffer disadvantage 2. Attacks at farther distances cannot be made. Note that ammunition for ranged weapons is generally not kept track of, as it is assumed you have brought enough ammo with you. A weapon like a rocket launcher should be handled as one-time use, consumable extraordinary item.<ul><li><p><strong>Range Increments</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Close Ranged</strong> - Range increment of 25’.</li><li><strong>Short Ranged</strong> - Range increment of 50’.</li><li><strong>Medium Ranged</strong> - Range increment of 75’.</li><li><strong>Long Ranged</strong> - Range increment of 125’.</li><li><strong>Extreme Ranged</strong> - Range increment of 300’.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Close</strong> and <strong>Short</strong> Ranged weapons are built to be compact and effective in close quarters, so they are less bulky. They can be wielded with a single hand, allowing the other hand to be used for carrying a shield, second weapon, or kept free for other actions.</li><li><strong>Medium</strong>, <strong>Long</strong>, and <strong>Extreme</strong> Ranged weapons have various strengths, but are not built for close quarters combat. As such, they require two hands and cannot be used with any weapon or other item in the wielders off hand.</li><li><p><strong>Extreme</strong> Ranged weapons are built for distance and given their specialized calibration, cannot be used to attack a target closer than 50’.</p></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>WL (Wealth Level)</strong> is an indication of how expensive the item is to purchase. See the <strong>Wealth</strong> section earlier in this chapter for an explanation of how that works.</p><p><strong>Properties</strong> are the descriptors that make each weapon unique from others. These properties translate to specific game mechanics described below.</p><p><strong>Banes</strong> indicate specific banes that the weapon is particularly effective at inflicting. When an attacker uses the weapon to inflict one of the listed banes, they may treat the Power Level as reduced by one for purposes of meeting attribute prerequisites. In addition, if you make a bane attack with the weapon, you get advantage 1 on the attack.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Weapons &amp;

id="properties">Properties</h3><p><strong>Burst</strong> - A burst weapon grants advantage equal to its value when its wielder makes a cube multi-target attack.</p><p><strong>Consumable</strong> - A consumable weapon breaks the usual rules of not tracking inventory. Each one occupies an inventory slot and attacking with the weapon consumes it, not to be used again.</p><p><strong>Deadly</strong> - Some weapons are so highly effective that they significantly increase damage potential beyond what the wielder would typically be capable of. Attacks made with this weapon gain advantage equal to their deadly value. A weapon cannot have a Deadly value greater than 3.</p><p><strong>Defensive</strong> - A defensive weapon grants advantage equal to its value when its wielder takes the Defend action. While wielding an item with the Defensive property, you do not gain the advantage 1 to attacks normally associated with Melee One-handed or Two-handed weapons. A weapon cannot have a Defensive value greater than 3.</p><p><strong>Delayed Ready</strong> - the weapon cannot be used more than once per round. In addition, after using the weapon, the wielder must spend a move action to ready the weapon before it can be used again.</p><p><strong>Forceful</strong> - This weapon can be used to make attacks with the Might attribute.</p><p><strong>Heavy</strong> – The weapon is particularly heavy to carry. You may carry a maximum number of <em>heavy</em> items equal to your Might score.</p><p><strong>Precise</strong> - This weapon can be used to make attacks with the Agility attribute.</p><p><strong>Reach</strong> - The weapon can be used to attack enemies 10’ away.</p><p><strong>Slow</strong> - If you are wielding this weapon at the beginning of combat, you gain disadvantage 2 on your initiative roll. If you are not wielding the weapon but plan to use it on your first turn, this penalty is applied. If you are wielding multiple weapons, your initiative modifier is equal to the slowest among them (slow, swift, or neither).</p><p><strong>Stationary</strong> - the bulk and weight of this weapon is enormous. Moving it requires a Focus Action from an assisting character which transports the weapon 30’.</p><p><strong>Swift</strong> - If you are wielding this weapon at the beginning of combat, you gain advantage 2 on your initiative roll. If you are not wielding the weapon but plan to use it on your first turn, you get this bonus. If you are wielding multiple weapons, your initiative modifier is equal to the slowest among them (slow, swift, or neither).</p><p><br><br></p><h2 id="armor">Armor</h2><p>Armor provides a bonus to your Guard defense, thus reducing or negating the damage that you would suffer from many types of attacks.</p><p>Armor comes in 3 types: light, medium, and heavy in terms of the protection they offer, ranging from a +1 to +3 bonus to your Guard defense. The examples below are general guidelines, feel free to create your own names, but armor should not grant a bonus greater than +3 to defense.</p><p>The Armor table summarizes the following properties of each type of armor:</p><p><strong>Required Might</strong> lists the minimum Might attribute score that a character requires in order to wear the armor. Without the appropriate Might score, a character cannot benefit from the protection afforded by the armor. When using multiple armor types, such as plate mail and a shield, you only need to meet the highest Might requirement.</p><p><strong>Defense Bonus</strong> indicates the bonus that your character gains to their Guard defense.</p><p><strong>Speed Penalty</strong> indicates the reduction in speed that your character suffers due to the bulkiness and weight of the armor.</p><p>Donning and removing armor takes 1 round for light armor, 1 minute for medium armor, and 10 minutes for heavy armor. Sleeping in medium or heavy armor is only possible with special training. Without the Armor Mastery feat, sleeping in armor causes your character to gain one level of the Fatigued bane, which applies disadvantage 1 to all action rolls until they get a proper night’s rest.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Armor</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr class="header"><th align="left">Examples</th><th align="center">Type</th><th align="center">Wealth Level</th><th align="center">Required Might</th><th align="center">Defense Bonus</th><th align="center">Speed Penalty</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="left">Leather Armor, Padding, Steelsilk</td><td align="center">Light</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">0</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="left">Kevlar Vest, Bioweave</td><td align="center">Medium</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">0</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="left">Chain Shirt, Full Body Armor</td><td align="center">Medium</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">0</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="left">Yoroi Armor, Plate Mail</td><td align="center">Heavy</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">5’</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="left">Power Armor, Elven Plate Mail</td><td align="center">Heavy</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">0</td></tr></tbody></table><p><br><br></p><h2 id="building-your-own-weapons">Building Your Own Weapons</h2><p>Open Legend is all about freeform creativity, so we’ve given you lots of examples with the Weapons table, but the list is by no means exhaustive. If you want to build your own custom weapon, follow the steps below</p><h3 id="step-1-choose-a-category">Step 1: Choose a Category</h3><p>Typically a weapon belongs to one category, however some weapons, such as a dagger or a hybrid sword-gun might fall into two categories. No weapon should fall into more than two categories, but selecting either one or two categories is at the discretion of the player and GM. This step has no impact on the weapon’s cost.</p><h3 id="step-2-choose-properties">Step 2: Choose Properties</h3><p>Every weapon must have either the <em>Forceful</em> or <em>Precise</em> property and some weapons have both. Choose one or both.</p><p>Next, you will may select a number of properties that have significant game impact, just like <em>Forceful</em> and <em>Precise</em>, these are listed under properties. The difference is that these other properties each have the effect of raising the Wealth Level of the weapon.</p><p>The <em>Deadly</em> property increases an item’s Wealth Level by 2 per tier. So a <em>Deadly 2</em> item has a starting Wealth Level 4.</p><p>The <em>Defensive</em> and <em>Burst</em> properties increase the Wealth Level of the item by 1 per tier, so <em>Defensive 3</em> would increase the item’s Wealth Level by 3.</p><p>The <em>Reach</em> and <em>Swift</em> properties increase the Wealth Level of an item by 1.</p><p>The <em>Consumable</em>, <em>Delayed Ready</em>, <em>Slow</em>, and <em>Stationary</em> properties reduce the Wealth Level of the item by 1.</p><p>If the item has the <em>Deadly</em> property, it’s Wealth Level cannot be lower than 4. Depending on the story, a GM may wish to lower this threshold if they want their game to be more dangerous or it takes place in a world where high-tech weapons or firearms are common.</p><h3 id="step-3-choose-banes">Step 3: Choose Banes</h3><p>Weapons are distinguished in terms of combat style and effectiveness by the banes associated with them. Banes do not impact Wealth Level, and a typical weapon will have 2 or 3 associated banes. Weapons with 4 or more associated banes must be approved by the GM.</p><h3 id="step-4-calculate-wealth-level">Step 4: Calculate Wealth Level</h3><p>Based on the decisions from your choices in Step 2 and Step 3, figure out the Wealth Level of the weapon.</p><h4 id="weapon-building-example-kusari-gama-chain-sickle">Weapon Building Example: Kusari-Gama (Chain &amp; Sickle)</h4><p>Let’s build our own weapon as an example. The kusaria-gama is a very unique weapon from Japanese history which is a combination of a chain and a kama (typical farming implement).</p><p><strong>Step 1 (Choose a Category)</strong> - While the kusari-gama, might typically be used as a short bladed melee weapon, it can also be swung via it’s long chain. As such, we will give it both the <strong>One-handed Melee</strong> and <strong>Close Ranged</strong> properties.</p><p><strong>Step 2 (Choose Properties)</strong> - Because the kusari-gama could be wielded either with nimble precision or a mighty swing of the chain or sickle, we will give it both the <strong>Precise</strong> and <strong>Forceful</strong> properties. For extra flavor, we will say that the chain’s ability to intercept and deflect attacks gives it the <strong>Defensive 1</strong> property, and also the <strong>Reach</strong> property for striking at a distance.</p><p><strong>Step 3 (Choose Banes)</strong> - In terms of combat style, the kusari-gama can be used to pull, trip, entangle, and threaten enemies in a wide area, as such we will say it has the following banes associated: <strong>Forced Move</strong>, <strong>Immobile</strong>, <strong>Knockdown</strong>, <strong>Provoked</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 4 (Calculate Wealth Level)</strong> - The properties in step 2 that impact Wealth Level add up to a total Wealth Level of 2, which will be the cost of the weapon.
