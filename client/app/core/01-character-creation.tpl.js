This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to creating your own hero. In <em>Open Legend</em>, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete quests and gain more experience adventuring, you’ll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you’ll learn what to do when you level up.</p><p>Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite fantasy movies, books, or video games.</p><p><em>Who were the characters you identified with?</em></p><p><em>Who inspired you?</em></p><p>Now that you’ve got some of your favorites in mind, let’s create your character.</p><h3 id="choose-an-example-character-modify-it">Choose an Example Character &amp; Modify It</h3><p>For anyone who feels they could benefit from some inspiration, you can easily make a copy of any of these spreadsheets (they include formulas for doing most all of the calculations for you), and then increase or decrease attribute scores, as well as add or remove feats. Be sure to adjust the <strong>Level</strong> field to get the correct calculations for attribute &amp; feat points at your current character level.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0Bx_UrXHMi3wmUlJjbDZiaGtIX00"><strong>View Pre-generated Character Options</strong></a></p><h2 id="step-1-choose-attributes">Step 1: Choose Attributes</h2><p>Attributes are the backbone of every character in <em>Open Legend</em>. They define what your character can and can’t do–the spheres he excels in, as well as his greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you’ll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.</p><p>In <em>Open Legend</em>, attributes are divided into four categories: physical, social, mental, and supernatural.</p><p>A character’s skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Supernatural attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.</p><p>The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th><strong>Physical Attributes at a Glance</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="width:10%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="6%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Agility</strong></td><td>Dodge attacks, move with stealth, perform acrobatics, shoot a bow, pick a pocket</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Fortitude</strong></td><td>Wear heavy armor, resist poison, shrug off pain, exert yourself physically</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Might</strong></td><td>Swing a maul, jump over a chasm, break down a door, wrestle a foe to submission</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Mental Attributes at a Glance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-head thirty-seventy"></div><table style="width:6%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Learning</strong></td><td>Recall facts about history, arcane magic, the natural world, etc.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Logic</strong></td><td>Solve riddles, decipher a code, improvise a tool, understand the enemy’s strategy, find a loophole</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Perception</strong></td><td>Sense ulterior motives, track someone, catch a gut feeling, spot a hidden foe, find a secret door</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Will</strong></td><td>Maintain your resolve, overcome adversity, resist torture, stay awake on watch, stave off insanity</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Social Attributes at a Glance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-head thirty-seventy"></div><table style="width:6%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Deception</strong></td><td>Tell a lie, bluff at cards, disguise yourself, spread rumors, swindle a sucker</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Persuasion</strong></td><td>Negotiate a deal, convince someone, haggle a good price, pry information</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Presence</strong></td><td>Give a speech, sing a song, inspire an army, exert your force of personality, have luck smile upon you</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Supernatural Attributes at a Glance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-head thirty-seventy"></div><table style="width:6%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Abjuration</strong></td><td>Protect from damage, break enchantments, dispel magic, bind demons</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Alteration</strong></td><td>Change shape, alter molecular structures, transmute one material into another</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Creation</strong></td><td>Channeling higher powers for healing, creation, resurrection, divine might, etc.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Divination</strong></td><td>See the future, read minds or auras, detect magic or evil, scry, communicate with extraplanar entities</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Enchantment</strong></td><td>Control the minds of others, dominate wills, speak telepathically, instill supernatural fear</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Energy</strong></td><td>Create and control the elements–fire, cold, electricity, etc.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Entropy</strong></td><td>Disintegrate matter, kill with a word, create undead, sicken others</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Illusion</strong></td><td>Create illusory figments, deceive the senses, cloak with invisibility</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Movement</strong></td><td>Teleport, fly, hasten, slow</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In <em>Open Legend</em>, you get to define your character’s strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept.

You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.</p><div class="table-no-body table-no-stripes table-even-header"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Toughness = 10 + Fortitude</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Toughness</strong> protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, or sturdiness.

Feats allow you to customize your character, granting him the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.</p><p>For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so he takes the <em>Combat Momentum</em> feat to allow him to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred berserker, takes <em>Berserker</em> so that she can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate her foes.</p><h3 id="choose-your-feats">Choose your feats</h3><p>Feats are purchased using feat points.

Choose your character’s race, and then choose <strong>one</strong> of the listed racial features.</p><h3 id="celestial">Celestial</h3><p><strong>Pure-hearted.</strong> Any good-aligned creature you encounter is friendly toward you by default rather than neutral. Circumstances can alter this, but even if rumors or actions you’ve taken would influence a good creature negatively, it remains one step friendlier than it otherwise would have been.</p><p><strong>Divine Insight.</strong> Drawing on a supernatural connection to a deity, you gain otherworldly insight. Once per game session, you can choose a topic relevant to the story. The GM shares some information about that topic which might be useful. If you’ve just failed a <em>Learning</em> attribute roll and use this ability, the GM decides whether to give you information related to that roll or to give you knowledge that is completely unrelated.</p><p><strong>Trustworthy</strong>. Once per session, you can choose to inspire trust in another character via your good-hearted nature. That character believes that you have their best interest in mind and seeks your advice on something that is troubling them, sharing a secret that they would not normally share with a stranger.</p><p><strong>Divine Intervention.</strong> As a divine agent, you are defended by your creator. Once per game session, when you are subject to a <em>Finishing Blow</em> while your hit points are below 1, you automatically heal to a hit point total of 1.</p><h3 id="dragonblood">Dragonblood</h3><p><strong>Legendary Bloodline</strong>. Having dragon’s blood, you command the respect of those who practice the Arcane arts. You are assumed to have knowledge and a destiny for greatness in the Arcane arts, and others treat you with deference. This influence could guarantee your placement within an Arcane College, grant you an apprenticeship with a famous Archmage, or cause a magic-user who does not know you well to follow a prescribed course of action based on your advice if the question is one of Arcane knowledge.</p><p><strong>Dragonspeak.</strong> Like the great wyrms of your ancestry, you have practiced the ways of sneaking hidden charms and subliminal messages within everyday conversation. Once per session, when you converse with an intelligent creature for at least five minutes, you will learn one useful secret of the GM’s choosing about the creature.</p><h3 id="dwarf">Dwarf</h3><p><strong>Warrior’s Code.</strong> As a veteran warrior, you command respect even from foes. Once per session, you can use this ability to cause an enemy or group of enemies to extend special concessions or favorable treatment toward you via an unspoken warrior’s code. The GM decides what these concessions look like. For example, your enemies might choose to trust you to come quietly and not shackle you, or overlook an insult that would have otherwise have been cause for bloodshed.</p><p><strong>Stone Sense.</strong> While underground you may fail to find what you’re looking for, but you can never be truly lost. You can always find your way back to the entrance through which you entered.</p><p><strong>Dwarven Resilience</strong>. Once per game session, you can automatically succeed a <em>Fortitude</em> action roll of Difficulty Level equal or less than your Fortitude score.</p><h3 id="elf">Elf</h3><p><strong>Elven Senses.</strong> Your keen senses allow you to notice details that others typically miss. Once per game session, you can use this ability to notice something out of the ordinary. For example, you might spot a hidden passage behind a bookcase, a trace of blood under the fingernails of another character, or a wig that is not quite convincing. If you use this ability after failing a <em>Perception</em> roll, the GM decides whether you notice the initial target of your roll or a different detail.</p><p><strong>Sylvan Ally</strong>. Creatures of nature can sense your deep respect for the natural order. Wild animals give you a wide berth, Druids give you the benefit of a doubt by assuming that you do not have destructive intentions, and you can typically gain an audience with the chief of a small local tribe by virtue of your race’s reputation for defending nature.</p><h3 id="feytouched">Feytouched</h3><p><strong>Whisperer of the Wild.</strong> Once per game session, you can ask a single “yes” or “no” question of a plant or animal within earshot. The plant or animal automatically trusts you at least enough to answer the question truthfully. You receive the answer by way of an inner sense, and so this ability cannot be used for further two-way communication.</p><p><strong>Fey Innocence.</strong> Your fey blood gives you a childlike quality that can melt even the coldest of hearts. Once per game session, you can leverage your fey innocence to turn an enemy and cause them to take pity on you. The enemy might choose to look the other way when you’ve done something illegal, forgive a debt you could never pay, or vouch in your favor before the authorities.</p><h3 id="half-orc">Half-Orc</h3><p><strong>Orcish Shakedown</strong>. While others might convince with a silver tongue, you speak the universal language of fear. Once per game session, if you make a show of physical force, you can use your <em>Might</em> attribute for a <em>Persuasion</em> roll. If your <em>Persuasion</em> score is already equal to or greater than your <em>Might</em> score, you get Advantage 1 on the roll.</p><p><strong>Orcish Scent.</strong> Your sense of smell is similar to that of a wild beast. As a focus action, you can discern the number and relative location of living creatures within 60’. With an additional focus action you can lock onto a particular scent and maintain its relative location as long as it remains within 60’.</p><h3 id="halfling">Halfling</h3><p><strong>Halfling Luck.</strong> Once per game session, in a moment of need, you can call on luck shine to upon you. The GM decides what form this luck takes. For example, an attack that was meant for you might target an ally instead, you may discover a secret passage to escape from a rolling boulder, or a town guardsman decides to overlook your crime because you happen to have grown up on the same street.</p><p><strong>Halfling Courage.</strong> You have a brave heart for such a small person. Once per game session, as a free action you can cancel the effects of any bane relating to fear or a penalty associated with negative morale.</p><h3 id="human">Human</h3><p><strong>Human Nobility.</strong> Being of high birth, you are treated as a benefactor by the lower classes. They will trust and help you in the hopes of being rewarded for their efforts. You are also treated as a peer by lesser nobles and can typically request an audience with them. In addition, representatives of the law generally assume you to be beyond reproach unless they are presented with compelling evidence to the contrary.</p><p><strong>Human Learning</strong>. You have a knack for picking up new skills. Once per game session, provided you are not under pressure from an inordinately tight deadline, you can automatically succeed at a non-attack action roll that relates to some craft, trade, skill, or similar work provided it is Difficulty Level 2 or less.</p><h2 id="step-5-choose-starting-equipment">Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment</h2><p>In a typical game of <em>Open Legend</em>, your character will start with the gear he needs for the basic adventuring life. The GM, however, may decide that the campaign starts under special circumstances (such as the entire party caged in a slave convoy) that might dictate otherwise.</p><p>Usually, though, you begin with a Wealth Score of 2, and may select up to three items of Wealth Level 2 and any number of items of a lesser Wealth Level. See chapter 4 for rules concerning Wealth as well as equipment details.</p><p>Instead of purchasing equipment a la carte, you may also elect to choose one of the following starting packages built for common character archetypes.

To make your character come to life, add the following details. If you can’t think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.</p><p><strong>A heroic name.</strong> Be sure to check with your GM to see if he has any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.</p><p><strong>Two exceptional physical traits.</strong> Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?</p><p><strong>Two defining social traits.</strong>Maybe you stutter when you’re nervous. Maybe you don’t trust anyone until they’ve proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.</p><p><strong>A secret.</strong> Your secret is something that other characters probably won’t find out about until they’ve gotten to know you quite well. It’s also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into his campaign. Here are a few examples of character secrets to give you some ideas:</p><p><em>Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.</em></p><p><em>Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child–that’s when he began his road to the priesthood.</em></p><p><em>Talia was raised as a Druid of the Briar Rose, but she fled the Order out of distaste for their violent ways. Now, she fears the reprisal of her ex-brethren at every turn.</em></p><h3 id="tell-your-story">Tell Your Story</h3><p>With your character created, you are all ready to start playing <em>Open Legend</em>. Whether you’re playing with old friends or complete strangers, and whether you’re completely new to roleplaying games or an experienced veteran, the following tips will help ensure a fun time for everyone at the table.</p><h3 id="relax">Relax</h3><p><em>Open Legend</em>gives you a chance to step out of everyday life for a few hours and into a fantastical world where you can perform heroic deeds. Pour the Mountain Dew or grab a beer, order some takeout or pop open the pretzels–but whatever you do, shake the dice like your life depends on it and have fun. If you’re playing a dwarf, maybe pull out your best Scottish accent. If your character’s a witch, squint your eyes and speak in riddles. If you’re no expert thespian, think of other ways to add to the fun: play adventurous music on your phone, illustrate the party’s escapades, and so on.</p><h3 id="respect-the-gm">Respect the GM</h3><p>If you’ve never GM’d before, you might not realize all the work that goes into it. More likely than not, your GM worked for hours to put her campaign together and prep for this session. Go with her storyline, overlook any accidental inconsistencies, and don’t cause a ruckus just for the sake of causing a ruckus. If there’s a dispute over the rules, accept the GM’s final ruling and agree to look it up later for the sake of the game.</p><h3 id="respect-the-other-players">Respect the Other Players</h3><p>Different people play roleplaying games for different reasons. Some enjoy the tactical, chess-like combat encounters. Others just want to tell an epic story. Still others are born actors, reveling in every conversation with every character. Whatever it is that you enjoy about playing <em>Open Legend</em>, just remember that not everyone else at the table may enjoy the same aspects. Part of the GM’s duty is to give everyone a chance to shine, but you can do your part too by not hogging the spotlight and by encouraging the other players to have fun, whatever that means for them.</p><h2 id="beyond-first-level">Beyond First Level</h2><p>As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character’s power will grow to match the challenge. This gain in power is called leveling up. The GM decides when characters level up. When your character does level up, you’ll have a few decisions to make.</p><h3 id="new-attribute-points">New Attribute Points</h3><p>Upon leveling up, you gain 9 new attribute points to spend. You can use these to increase your current attributes or buy completely new ones. The cost to increase an attribute is equal to the new score. So, for example, to raise your Might from 3 to 4 would cost 4 attribute points. The cost to purchase a brand new attribute is summarized in the Attribute Overview Table.</p><p>Until you reach 5th level, the maximum attribute score is 5. From levels 6 to 9, the maximum is equal to your level.</p><p>You do not have to use all of your attribute points at once, any remaining attribute points can be saved for use at future levels.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Attribute Overview</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th align="center">Attribute Score</th><th align="center">Cost</th><th align="center">Attribute Dice</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1d4</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">1d6</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">1d8</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">1d10</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">15</td><td align="center">2d6</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">21</td><td align="center">2d8</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">28</td><td align="center">2d10</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">36</td><td align="center">3d8</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">45</td><td align="center">3d10</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="new-feats">New Feats</h3><p>Whenever you gain a level, you gain 3 feat points to purchase new feats. You do not have to use all of these at once, and any remaining feat points can be saved for future levels.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats"><em>Feats</em></a> to view the complete list of feats to choose from.</p><h3 id="new-hit-points">New Hit Points</h3><p>In <em>Open Legend</em>, attributes are the means by which your hit points increase. If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase either your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attribute. As outlined in the default hit point formula, you’ll gain 2 hit points each time you raise one of those attributes by one.</p>');
