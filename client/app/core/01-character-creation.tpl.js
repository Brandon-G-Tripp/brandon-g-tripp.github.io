This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to create your own hero. In Open Legend, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete missions or quests and gain more experience as a hero, you’ll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you’ll learn what to do when you level up.</p><p>Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite movies, books, or video games.</p><p><em>Who were the characters you identified with?</em></p><p><em>Who inspired you?</em></p><p>Now that you’ve got some of your favorites in mind, let’s create your character.</p><blockquote><h3 id="pre-generated-characters-to-get-you-started">Pre-generated Characters to Get You Started</h3><p>If you would like some character inspiration or an easy place to start, you can browse the pre-generated characters linked below. If you find a character you would like to use, simply copy the spreadsheet and adjust as you see fit. The spreadsheets include formulas to do most of the calculations for you, and you can adjust the <strong>Level</strong> field to generate the appropriate number of feat and attribute points if you are creating a character above first level.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0Bx_UrXHMi3wmUlJjbDZiaGtIX00"><strong>View Pre-generated Character Options</strong></a></p></blockquote><h2 id="step-1-describe-your-character">Step 1: Describe Your Character</h2><p>Open Legend is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than merely a selection of attributes, feats, perks, and gear. To make your character come to life, add some of the following details. If you can’t think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.</p><p><strong>A heroic name.</strong> Be sure to check with your GM to see if they have any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.</p><p><strong>Your race.</strong> Your decision of race is limited only by your imagination, the setting, and the constraints provided by your GM. A typical fantasy campaign might feature dwarves, elves, halflings, celestials, and dragon-blooded. If you are playing in a futuristic space opera on the fringes of the galaxy, your GM might have several alien races to choose from. Some campaigns, such as a mystery of Lovecraftian horror, might allow only for regular old humans. Really, though, as long as it is approved by your GM, you can play anything you would like, whether that’s a psionic humanoid tiger, a 3-inch tall pixie, or anything in between.</p><p>As part of deciding your race, you should also choose your <strong>size</strong>: small, medium, or large. A medium character is roughly the size of an average human. Small creatures range from about 2 - 4 feet in height, while large creatures are about 7 - 10 feet tall. A large creature occupies a 10’x10’ square in combat and has a 10’ reach (see Chapter 7: Combat for details). The GM may assign advantage or disadvantage during situations in which your size is relevant. For example, small creatures may gain advantage on rolls to hide and receive disadvantage on rolls to kick down a door. Likewise, large creatures might suffer disadvantage on attack rolls when fighting in confined spaces but gain advantage on rolls to intimidate smaller creatures.</p><p>At the GM’s discretion, you may choose to be even smaller or larger than the sizes described above. A large creature’s reach is always equal to the length of its base. So, a giant with a 15’x15’ base would have a 15’ reach. Small creatures always have at least a 5’ reach.</p><blockquote><h3 id="no-racial-abilities-or-adjustments">No Racial Abilities or Adjustments?</h3><p>In Open Legend, races do not provide specific mechanical costs and benefits. Instead, you’ll have a chance to further define your character in a later step of character creation by choosing your perks and flaws. Some or all of your decisions at that stage may be influenced by your race, and you are encouraged to explain to the rest of your group how your race informs your choice of perks and flaws. For example, if you are playing a psionic humanoid tiger, you might choose the <em>scent</em> perk to highlight your hunter’s bloodline and the <em>observant</em> perk to simulate your extrasensory perception. Likewise, you could select the <em>hot tempered</em> flaw to represent the savage animal that still lurks beneath your intelligent outer shell.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Two exceptional physical traits.</strong> Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?</p><p><strong>Two defining social traits.</strong> Maybe you stutter when you’re nervous. Maybe you don’t trust anyone until they’ve proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.</p><p><strong>A secret.</strong> Your secret is something that other characters probably won’t find out about until they’ve gotten to know you quite well. It’s also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into the campaign.</p><blockquote><h3 id="example-character-secrets">Example Character Secrets</h3><p>Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.</p><hr><p>Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child–that’s when he began his road to the priesthood.</p><hr><p>Talia suffered from a horrible car accident as a youth. She only survived because a mad street doctor found her body and kept it alive with a number of cybernetic implants that have left her half machine, both physically and mentally.</p></blockquote><h2 id="step-2-choose-attributes">Step 2: Choose Attributes</h2><p>Attributes are the backbone of every character in Open Legend. They define what your character can and can’t do–the spheres they excel in, as well as their greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you’ll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.</p><p>In Open Legend, attributes are divided into four categories: physical, social, mental, and extraordinary.</p><p>A character’s skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). A character cannot use an extraordinary attribute if they have a score of zero, though physical, social, and mental attributes may still be used untrained.</p><p>The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Extraordinary attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.</p><p>The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish. All of the attributes are explained in further detail in Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th><strong>Physical Attributes at a Glance</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table style="width:10%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="6%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Agility</strong></td><td>Dodge attacks, move with stealth, perform acrobatics, shoot a bow, pick a pocket</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Fortitude</strong></td><td>Resist poison, shrug off pain, survive in a desert, wear heavy armor</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Might</strong></td><td>Swing a maul, jump over a chasm, break down a door, wrestle a foe to submission</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Mental Attributes at a Glance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-head thirty-seventy"></div><table style="width:6%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Learning</strong></td><td>Recall facts about history, arcane magic, the natural world, etc.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Logic</strong></td><td>Solve riddles, decipher a code, improvise a tool, understand the enemy’s strategy, find a loophole</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Perception</strong></td><td>Sense ulterior motives, track someone, catch a gut feeling, spot a hidden foe, find a secret door</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Will</strong></td><td>Maintain your resolve, overcome adversity, resist torture, stay awake on watch, stave off insanity</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Social Attributes at a Glance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-head thirty-seventy"></div><table style="width:6%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Deception</strong></td><td>Tell a lie, bluff at cards, disguise yourself, spread rumors, swindle a sucker</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Persuasion</strong></td><td>Negotiate a deal, convince someone, haggle a good price, pry information</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Presence</strong></td><td>Give a speech, sing a song, inspire an army, exert your force of personality, have luck smile upon you</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Extraordinary Attributes at a Glance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="table-no-head thirty-seventy"></div><table style="width:6%;"><colgroup><col width="2%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Alteration</strong></td><td>Change shape, alter molecular structures, transmute one material into another</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Creation</strong></td><td>Channel higher powers for healing, creation, regeneration, divine might, etc.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Energy</strong></td><td>Create and control the elements–fire, cold, electricity, etc.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Entropy</strong></td><td>Disintegrate matter, kill with a word, create undead, sicken others</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Influence</strong></td><td>Control the minds of others, speak telepathically, instill fear, create illusory figments, cloak with invisibility</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Movement</strong></td><td>Teleport, fly, hasten, slow</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><strong>Prescience</strong></td><td>See the future, read minds or auras, detect magic or evil, scry, communicate with extraplanar entities</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><strong>Protection</strong></td><td>Protect from damage, break supernatural influence, dispel magic, bind demons</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In Open Legend, you get to define your character’s strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept.

Pour the Mountain Dew or grab a beer, order some takeout or pop open the pretzels–but whatever you do, shake the dice like your character’s life depends on it and have fun. If you’re playing a dwarf, maybe pull out your best Scottish accent. If your character’s a witch, squint your eyes and speak in riddles. If you’re no expert thespian, think of other ways to add to the fun: play adventurous music on your phone, illustrate the party’s escapades, and so on.</p><h3 id="respect-the-gm">Respect the GM</h3><p>If you’ve never GM’d before, you might not realize all the work that goes into it. More likely than not, your GM worked for hours to put their campaign together and prep for this session. Go with their storyline, overlook any accidental inconsistencies, and don’t cause a ruckus just for the sake of causing a ruckus. If there’s a dispute over the rules, accept the GM’s final ruling and agree to look it up later for the sake of keeping the game going.</p><h3 id="respect-the-other-players">Respect the Other Players</h3><p>Different people play roleplaying games for different reasons. Some enjoy the tactical, chess-like combat encounters. Others just want to tell an epic story. Still others are born actors, reveling in every conversation with every character. Whatever it is that you enjoy about playing Open Legend, just remember that not everyone else at the table may enjoy the same aspects. Part of the GM’s duty is to give everyone a chance to shine, but you can do your part too by not hogging the spotlight and by encouraging the other players to have fun, whatever that means for them.</p><h2 id="gaining-xp-and-leveling-up">Gaining XP and Leveling Up</h2><p>As the legend you are creating unfolds and grows in danger and magnitude, your character’s power will grow to match the challenge. This power comes in the form of experience points (or XP), which are rewarded by the GM and allow you to advance in level and gain access to new feats, attributes, banes, and boons.</p><p>Your total XP earned determines your level, with every 3 XP allowing you to advance to the next level. Your level is used to determine your maximum attribute score as well as to provide a general indication of your power compared to other characters and enemy or ally NPCs. The Player Character Level Advancement table details the XP requirements and maximum attribute score for each level.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Player Character Level Advancement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th align="center">Total XP</th><th align="center">Level</th><th align="center">Maximum Attribute Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">6</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">6</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">7</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">15</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">7</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">18</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">8</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">21</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">8</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">24</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">9</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">27</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">9</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="feat-and-attribute-points">Feat and Attribute Points</h3><p>For every XP that you earn, you also gain 1 feat point and 3 attribute points. These can be spent immediately or saved for later. You gain these feat and attribute points <em>every</em> time you are awarded XP, not just when you level up.</p><p>Attribute points can be used to increase your current attributes or buy completely new ones. The cost to increase an attribute is equal to the new score. So, for example, to raise your Might from 3 to 4 would cost 4 attribute points. The cost to purchase a brand new attribute is summarized in the Attribute Overview Table, which also details the attribute dice for scores above 5.</p><p>See <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats"><em>Feats</em></a> to view the complete list of feats to choose from.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Attribute Overview</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th align="center">Attribute Score</th><th align="center">Cost</th><th align="center">Attribute Dice</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1d4</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">1d6</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">1d8</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">1d10</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">15</td><td align="center">2d6</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">21</td><td align="center">2d8</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">28</td><td align="center">2d10</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">36</td><td align="center">3d8</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">45</td><td align="center">3d10</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">4d8</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Note:</strong> An attribute score of 10 cannot be purchased with attribute points. It can only be obtained through feats, boons, or other special means. No attribute may advance beyond a score of 10.</p><h3 id="new-hit-points">New Hit Points</h3><p>In Open Legend, attributes are the means by which your hit points increase. If you want your character to be able to take more hits, increase either your Fortitude, Presence, or Will attribute. As outlined in the default hit point formula, you’ll gain 2 hit points each time you raise any of those attributes by one.</p><h2 id="starting-beyond-first-level">Starting Beyond First Level</h2><p>Sometimes a new player will join a campaign in progress in which the other PCs have already advanced several levels, so it would be unbalanced to insert a first level character into the party. Other times, the GM may decide to run a campaign with PCs who have already accumulated some wealth and power. In situations like these, you can use the Characters Beyond First Level table to determine attribute points, feat points, and wealth for PCs. When choosing starting gear, you may select three items of your current wealth score and any number of lesser valued items.</p><div class="table-no-body"></div><table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Characters Beyond First Level</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br></p><table><thead><tr class="header"><th align="center">Level</th><th align="center">XP</th><th align="center">Attribute Points</th><th align="center">Max Attribute</th><th align="center">Feat Points</th><th align="center">Wealth Score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">49</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">2</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">58</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">3</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">67</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">15</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">76</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">18</td><td align="center">4</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">15</td><td align="center">85</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">21</td><td align="center">5</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">18</td><td align="center">94</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">24</td><td align="center">6</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">21</td><td align="center">103</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">27</td><td align="center">6</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">24</td><td align="center">112</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">30</td><td align="center">7</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">27</td><td align="center">121</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">33</td><td align="center">8</td></tr></tbody></table>');
