This chapter will offer you step-by-step instructions to create your own hero. In Open Legend, you typically begin as a level one character. As you complete missions or quests and gain more experience as a hero, you’ll level up and gain more power. These rules explain how to create a character starting at level one. Later, you’ll learn what to do when you level up.</p><p>Before reading on, take a minute and think of your favorite movies, books, or video games.</p><p><em>Who were the characters you identified with?</em></p><p><em>Who inspired you?</em></p><p>Now that you’ve got some of your favorites in mind, let’s create your character.</p><h2 id="step-1-describe-your-character">Step 1: Describe Your Character</h2><p>Open Legend is a role playing game, which means your character will need more depth than merely a selection of attributes, feats, perks, and gear. To make your character come to life, add some of the following details. If you can’t think of anything yet, try to fill in the blanks during your first couple of play sessions as you get to know your character better.</p><p><strong>A heroic name.</strong> Be sure to check with your GM to see if they have any particular setting in mind. Phil the Fighter would feel quite out of place next to Therilas Windcaster and Gorion Skullcleaver.</p><p><strong>Your race.</strong> Your decision of race is limited only by your imagination, the setting, and the constraints provided by your GM. A typical fantasy campaign might feature dwarves, elves, halflings, celestials, and dragon-blooded. If you are playing in a futuristic space opera on the fringes of the galaxy, your GM might have several alien races to choose from. Some campaigns, such as a mystery of Lovecraftian horror, might allow only for regular old humans. Really, though, as long as it is approved by your GM, you can play anything you would like, whether that’s a psionic humanoid tiger, a 3-inch tall pixie, or anything in between.</p><p>As part of deciding your race, you should also choose your <strong>size</strong>: small, medium, or large. A medium character is roughly the size of an average human. Small creatures range from about 2 - 4 feet in height, while large creatures are about 7 - 10 feet tall. A large creature occupies a 10’x10’ square in combat and has a 10’ reach (see Chapter 7: Combat for details). The GM may assign advantage or disadvantage during situations in which your size is relevant. For example, small creatures may gain advantage on rolls to hide and receive disadvantage on rolls to kick down a door. Likewise, large creatures might suffer disadvantage on attack rolls when fighting in confined spaces but gain advantage on rolls to intimidate smaller creatures.</p><p>At the GM’s discretion, you may choose to be smaller or larger than the listed sizes. A large creature’s reach is always equal to the length of its base. So, a giant with a 15’x15’ base would have a 15’ reach. All creatures have at least a 5’ reach.</p><pre><code></code></pre><div style="padding-top: 10px;"></div><blockquote><h5 id="no-racial-abilities-or-adjustments">No Racial Abilities or Adjustments?</h5><p>In Open Legend, races do not provide specific mechanical costs and benefits. Instead, you’ll have a chance to further define your character in a later step of character creation by choosing your perks and flaws. Some or all of your decisions at that stage may be influenced by your race, and you are encouraged to explain to the rest of your group how your race informs your choice of perks and flaws. For example, if you are playing a psionic humanoid tiger, you might choose the <em>scent</em> perk to highlight your hunter’s bloodline and the <em>observant</em> perk to simulate your extrasensory perception. Likewise, you could select the <em>hot tempered</em> flaw to represent the savage animal that still lurks beneath your intelligent outer shell.</p></blockquote><div style="padding-top: 60px;"></div><p><strong>Two exceptional physical traits.</strong> Think of the first two features that other characters notice when they see you. Do your eyes glow red when you are angry? Are you seven feet tall? Is your hair a rainbow hue?</p><p><strong>Two defining social traits.</strong> Maybe you stutter when you’re nervous. Maybe you don’t trust anyone until they’ve proven themselves to you. Or, perhaps, you are a winsome bard who almost always talks in sing-song. Your two social traits should be characteristics that others will learn shortly after getting to know you.</p><p><strong>A secret.</strong> Your secret is something that other characters probably won’t find out about until they’ve gotten to know you quite well. It’s also a seed for great adventure that the GM can weave into the campaign.</p><div style="padding-top: 60px;"></div><blockquote><h5 id="example-character-secrets">Example Character Secrets</h5><p>Before Volkor changed his name and began wandering the land as a barbarian sellsword, he was heir to the throne.</p><hr><p>Sir Thomas Tuckburrough served as an assassin for the local thieves guild until a job went bad and he murdered an innocent child–that’s when he began his road to the priesthood.</p><hr><p>Talia suffered from a horrible car accident as a youth. She only survived because a mad street doctor found her body and kept it alive with a number of cybernetic implants that have left her half machine, both physically and mentally.</p></blockquote><div class="pageNumber auto"></div><h2 id="step-2-choose-attributes">Step 2: Choose Attributes</h2><p>Attributes are the backbone of every character in Open Legend. They define what your character can and can’t do–the spheres they excel in, as well as their greatest weaknesses. Whenever your character attempts a heroic action in Open Legend, you’ll look to your attributes to see how well you succeed or fail.</p><p>In Open Legend, attributes are divided into four categories: physical, social, mental, and extraordinary.</p><p>A character’s skill with each attribute is expressed as a score from 0 (completely unpracticed) to 9 (superhuman). A character cannot use an extraordinary attribute if they have a score of zero, though physical, social, and mental attributes may still be used untrained.</p><p>The average commoner or craftsmen usually has scores ranging from 1 - 3 in several physical, social, and mental attributes. Extraordinary attributes are generally reserved for characters of power and note.</p><p>The Attributes at a Glance tables provide a quick overview of some of the common actions that each attribute will help you accomplish. All of the attributes are explained in further detail in Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes.</p><div style="margin-top:80px"></div><div style="text-align: center"><h5 id="physical-attributes-at-a-glance">Physical Attributes at a Glance</h5></div>|<div style="width: 400px;"></div><table style="width:29%;"><colgroup><col width="11%"><col width="18%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center"><strong>Agility</strong></td><td>Dodge attacks, move with stealth, perform acrobatics, shoot a bow, pick a pocket</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center"><strong>Fortitude</strong></td><td>Resist poison, shrug off pain, survive in a desert, wear heavy armor</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center"><strong>Might</strong></td><td>Swing a maul, jump over a chasm, break down a door, wrestle a foe to submission</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="margin-top:220px"></div><div style="text-align: center"><h5 id="mental-attributes-at-a-glance">Mental Attributes at a Glance</h5></div>|<div style="width: 400px;"></div><table style="width:14%;"><colgroup><col width="9%"><col width="4%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center"><strong>Learning</strong></td><td align="left">Recall facts about history, arcane magic, the natural world, etc.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center"><strong>Logic</strong></td><td align="left">Solve riddles, decipher a code, improvise a tool, understand the enemy’s strategy, find a loophole</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center"><strong>Perception</strong></td><td align="left">Sense ulterior motives, track someone, catch a gut feeling, spot a hidden foe, find a secret door</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center"><strong>Will</strong></td><td align="left">Maintain your resolve, overcome adversity, resist torture, stay awake on watch, stave off insanity</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="margin-top:150px"></div><div style="text-align: center"><h5 id="social-attributes-at-a-glance">Social Attributes at a Glance</h5></div>|<div style="width: 400px;"></div><table style="width:8%;"><colgroup><col width="5%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center"><strong>Deception</strong></td><td>Tell a lie, bluff at cards, disguise yourself, spread rumors, swindle a sucker</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center"><strong>Persuasion</strong></td><td>Negotiate a deal, convince someone, haggle a good price, pry information</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center"><strong>Presence</strong></td><td>Give a speech, sing a song, inspire an army, exert your force of personality, have luck smile upon you</td></tr></tbody></table><pre><code></code></pre><div style="text-align: center"><h5 id="extraordinary-attributes-at-a-glance">Extraordinary Attributes at a Glance</h5></div>|<div style="width: 400px;"></div><table style="width:8%;"><colgroup><col width="5%"><col width="2%"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td align="center"><strong>Alteration</strong></td><td>Change shape, alter molecular structures, transmute one material into another</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center"><strong>Creation</strong></td><td>Channel higher powers, manifest something from nothing, regenerate, divinely bolster, etc.</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center"><strong>Energy</strong></td><td>Create and control the elements–fire, cold, electricity, etc.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center"><strong>Entropy</strong></td><td>Disintegrate matter, kill with a word, create undead, sicken others</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center"><strong>Influence</strong></td><td>Control the minds of others, speak telepathically, instill fear, create illusory figments, cloak with invisibility</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center"><strong>Movement</strong></td><td>Teleport, fly, hasten, slow</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td align="center"><strong>Prescience</strong></td><td>See the future, read minds or auras, view from afar, detect magic or evil, communicate with extraplanar entities</td></tr><tr class="even"><td align="center"><strong>Protection</strong></td><td>Protect from damage, break supernatural influence, dispel magic, bind demons</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In Open Legend, you get to define your character’s strengths and weaknesses by choosing the attributes that fit your character concept.

You have three defense scores, and each one protects you from different types of attacks. The higher your defense, the better you are at avoiding or shrugging off whatever your foes throw at you.</p><div class="descriptive">**<div style="text-align: center">Toughness = 10 + Fortitude + Will</div><p>**</p></div><p><strong>Toughness</strong> protects you from attacks that test your endurance, bodily health, sturdiness, and survivability. For example, foes attempting to poison you, drain your life force, or stun you will target your toughness.</p><div class="descriptive">**<div style="text-align: center">Guard = 10 + Agility + Might + Armor</div><p>**</p></div><p><strong>Guard</strong> protects you from attacks that can either be dodged, deflected, or directly withstood via raw physical power. Your enemies would need to overcome your guard in order to hit you with a grenade, shoot you with an arrow, or smash you with a maul.</p><div class="descriptive">**<div style="text-align: center">Resolve = 10 + Presence + Will</div><p>**</p></div><p><strong>Resolve</strong> represents your character’s ability to resist mental domination and stand brave in the face of danger.

Multiply the total by 2. Finally, add 10.</em></p><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> (or HP) are an abstract measure of how well you can ignore pain, avoid deadly blows, and maintain a presence on the battlefield in spite of wounds or exhaustion. If they reach zero, you fall unconscious and are at risk of death.</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> indicates how far your character can move using a single move action (see Chapter 7: Combat). Your base speed is 30 feet. Other effects, such as banes, boons, and feats may cause your speed to increase or decrease.</p><p><br></p><blockquote><h5 id="roll-them-bones">Roll Them Bones</h5><p>If you are new to gaming, you may not be familiar with dice notation, such as 2d6.</p><p>As you play Open Legend, you’ll often need to roll dice to determine the outcome of actions. <strong>Dice notation</strong> is a shorthand way of indicating which dice to roll.</p><p>Every die roll is indicated by a formula such as 3d6. The number before the <em>d</em> indicates how many dice to roll, and the number after the <em>d</em> indicates how many sides those dice have.</p><p>So, 3d6 means that you roll three six-sided dice.</p><p>5d4 indicates five four-sided dice.</p><p>And so on.</p></blockquote><p><br></p><h2 id="step-4-purchase-feats">Step 4: Purchase Feats</h2><p>While your character’s attributes define your skill at accomplishing heroic tasks, your <strong>feats</strong> are what make you unique among other characters. Feats allow you to customize your character, granting you the ability to accomplish specific actions exceptionally well.</p><p>For example, two different characters who specialize in melee combat might both start with a Might score of 5. However, one character is a swashbuckling pirate, so she takes the <em>Combat Momentum</em> feat to move deftly from one foe to the next like a whirling dervish. The other, a battle-scarred barbarian, takes <em>Battle Trance</em> so that he can fly into a frenzied rage in order to decimate foes.</p><h3 id="choose-your-feats">Choose your feats</h3><p>Feats are purchased using feat points. At 1st level, you have 6 feat points to spend. Any leftover feat points may be saved for the future.</p><p>You can read the feat descriptions in a searchable list <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/feats"><em>here</em></a>.</p><h2 id="step-5-choose-starting-equipment">Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment</h2><p>In a typical game of Open Legend, your character will start with the gear they need for the basic adventuring life. The GM, however, may decide that the campaign starts under special circumstances (such as the entire party caged in a slave convoy) that might dictate otherwise.</p><div class="pageNumber auto"></div><p>Usually, though, you begin with a wealth score of 2, and may select up to three items of wealth level 2 and any number of items of a lesser wealth level. See chapter 5 for rules concerning wealth as well as equipment details. After selecting your equipment, be sure to note any changes to your defenses or other statistics.</p><h2 id="step-6-choose-perks-flaws">Step 6: Choose Perks &amp; Flaws</h2><p>Perks and flaws provide you with additional ways to define your character’s personality, appearance, strengths, weaknesses, and background. Complete descriptions of the available perks and flaws, as well as how they are used in play, are described in Chapter 4: Perks &amp; Flaws.</p><p>At character creation, you may optionally choose up to two perks and up to two flaws. You do not have to choose any.</p><h2 id="step-7-tell-your-story">Step 7: Tell Your Story</h2><p>With your character created, you are all ready to start playing Open Legend. Whether you’re playing with old friends or complete strangers, and whether you’re completely new to roleplaying games or an experienced veteran, the following tips will help ensure a fun time for everyone at the table.</p><h3 id="relax">Relax</h3><p>Open Legend gives you a chance to step out of everyday life for a few hours and into a fantastical world where you can perform heroic deeds. Pour the Mountain Dew or grab a beer, order some takeout or pop open the pretzels–but whatever you do, shake the dice like your character’s life depends on it and have fun. If you’re playing a dwarf, maybe pull out your best Scottish accent. If your character’s a witch, squint your eyes and speak in riddles. If you’re no expert thespian, think of other ways to add to the fun: play adventurous music on your phone, illustrate the party’s escapades, and so on.</p><h3 id="respect-the-gm">Respect the GM</h3><p>If you’ve never GM’d before, you might not realize all the work that goes into it. More likely than not, your GM worked for hours to put their campaign together and prep for this session. Go with their storyline, overlook any accidental inconsistencies, and don’t cause a ruckus just for the sake of causing a ruckus. If there’s a dispute over the rules, accept the GM’s final ruling and agree to look it up later for the sake of keeping the game going.</p><h3 id="respect-the-other-players">Respect the Other Players</h3><p>Different people play roleplaying games for different reasons. Some enjoy the tactical, chess-like combat encounters. Others just want to tell an epic story. Still others are born actors, reveling in every conversation with every character. Whatever it is that you enjoy about playing Open Legend, just remember that not everyone else at the table may enjoy the same aspects. Part of the GM’s duty is to give everyone a chance to shine, but you can do your part too by not hogging the spotlight and by encouraging the other players to have fun, whatever that means for them.</p><pre><code></code></pre><h2 id="archetype-builds">Archetype Builds</h2><p>This section contains an assortment of characters built for a variety of genres. If you do not want to create your own character from scratch, you can use these as is. Just add your own perks, flaws, and descriptive traits and you are ready to go. Alternatively, you might use one of these archetypes to get you started, swapping out attributes and feats to develop your own unique character concept for the setting that you will be playing in.</p><h3 id="bard">Bard</h3><p>Bards are a little bit of everything: leaders, loremasters, artists, performers, magicians, swashbucklers, and more. A bard is a jack-of-all-trades who gets allies out of the frying pan just as often as they land them in the fire.</p><h4 id="strategy">Strategy</h4><p>Bards can lend a helping hand in almost any non-combat scenario by using their <em>well-rounded</em> feat, though they particularly excel in social situations thanks to their strong Presence and Persuasion attributes. Their Influence score also provides access to banes such as <em>charmed</em> and <em>phantasm</em>, which can be useful for deceiving enemies, winning them over, or prying information out of them.</p><p>In combat, a Bard supports allies with <em>bolster</em>, using the <em>boon focus</em> feat to inspire as many allies as possible at once. When friends are wounded, the Bard uses <em>heal</em> to get them back in the fight, and can even help several allies hold the line by invoking a healing <em>aura</em>. Bards are reasonably adept in melee combat, using their rapier to disarm foes whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p><hr><ul><li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 3 (1d8), Learning 3 (1d8), Will 3 (1d8), Presence 4 (1d10), Persuasion 3 (1d8), Influence 3 (1d8)</li><li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 24</li><li><strong>Guard:</strong> 14 (15 with shield - Agility 3, Leather Armor 1)</li><li><strong>Toughness:</strong> 13</li><li><strong>Resolve:</strong> 17</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’ ___</li><li><strong>Feats:</strong> Well-rounded, Boon Focus I (Bolster), Great Leap ___</li><li><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Leather Armor, Rapier (treat as Longsword), Small Shield, Lore Book, Musical Instrument ___ <strong>Favored Actions:</strong></p></li><li><em>Rapier</em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard</li><li><em>En Garde!</em> (inflict <em>disarm</em>): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1</li><li><em>Inspiring Word</em> (invoke <em>bolster</em>):<br>→ 1 target: Auto-success of PL 3 via <em>boon focus</em><br>→ 10’ cube: Presence vs. 16 (PL 3)</li><li><em>Healing Word</em> (invoke <em>heal</em>): Presence vs. 12 - 18 (PL 1 - 4)</li><li><em>Song of Vivification</em> (invoke 5’ <em>aura: heal</em>): Presence vs. 18 (PL 4)</li><li><em>Winning Smile</em> (inflict <em>charmed</em>): Influence vs. Resolve</li><li><p><em>Magic Trick</em> (inflict <em>phantasm</em>): Influence vs. Resolve</p></li></ul><div class="pageNumber auto"></div><h3 id="battle-mage">Battle Mage</h3><p>Battle Mages are masters of might and magic.

Whether the Chronomage is slowing down time to allow their companions to move with seemingly inhuman speed, speeding up the flow of time to exhaust the enemy, or reversing time to close wounds, the Chronomage is able to use their mastery over the fourth dimension to gain an advantage in any situation. They make use of the <em>boon focus</em> feat to invoke these beneficial baleful effects in a field around them or an ally. <em>Attribute substitution</em> protects their fragile physical forms, which are neither strong nor agile outside of their powers.

The air of gravitas that they carry compels all who encounter them like clay in the courtier’s hands. As a host, a courtier will often have a social gathering engineered down to the most minute detail, such that guests feel exactly as the courtier has planned for them to feel. Often they command respect with regal attire, whether a showcase of Victorian splendor, Far Eastern grace, or the sleek fashion of the world’s modern day rich and powerful.</p><h4 id="strategy-5">Strategy</h4><p>Specialized primarily in social situations and of little help when a fight breaks out, a courtier invests most of their effort in engineering circumstances to avoid bloodshed. When that fails, they aim to ally themselves with the side heavily favored to win. This is accomplished through the use of Deception, Persuasion, Presence, and Influence. Once the Courtier has earned the trust of a powerful acquaintance via the <em>charmed</em> bane, it’s common for the target to remain indefinitely loyal to the Courtier, thanks to the <em>potent bane</em> and <em>unending charm</em> feats.</p><hr><ul><li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 2 (1d6), Will 3 (1d8), Deception 4 (1d10), Presence 3 (1d8), Influence 5 (2d6)</li><li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 22</li><li><strong>Guard:</strong> 13 (Agility 2, Steelsilk Armor 1)</li><li><strong>Toughness:</strong> 13</li><li><strong>Resolve:</strong> 16</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’ ___</li><li><strong>Feats:</strong> Potent Bane (Charmed), Unending Charm ___</li><li><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Majestic Clothing, Dagger, Compact Pistol (Handgun), Steelsilk Armor ___ <strong>Favored Actions:</strong></p></li><li><em>Master Conversationalist</em> (inflict <em>charmed</em>): Influence vs. Resolve</li><li><em>Scathing Insult</em> (inflict <em>demoralized</em>): Influence vs. Resolve</li><li><em>Conflicting Stories</em> (inflict <em>memory alteration</em>): Influence vs. Resolve</li><li><em>Sympathetic Ear</em> (inflict <em>truthfulness</em>): Influence vs. Resolve</li><li><em>Personal Favor</em> (inflict <em>dominated</em>): Influence vs. Resolve</li><li><p><em>Hidden Pistol</em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard</p></li></ul><h3 id="druid">Druid</h3><p>Druids are defenders of nature who draw upon its power via a close bond that enables them to shapechange into many of the powerful creatures found in their natural habitats. Not all druids are attuned to the woodlands.

Whatever their preferred habitat, druids are nothing if not adaptable.</p><h4 id="strategy-6">Strategy</h4><p>Being one with nature, druids tend to use natural surroundings to their advantage, whether summoning up an imposing wall of briars with the <em>barrier</em> boon, an animated vine that entwines the target with <em>immobile</em>, or hastening the healing power of nature via the <em>regeneration</em> boon. Druids also make excellent combatants and scouts. As a scout, they are able to sneak unnoticed into an enemy camp as a naturally occurring animal species. As a combatant, they can shift into a massive and powerful creature, such as a bear to quickly deal with enemies.</p><hr><ul><li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 2 (1d6), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Might 2 (1d6), Perception 2 (1d6), Will 2 (1d6), Alteration 5 (2d6), Creation 3 (1d8)</li><li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20</li><li><strong>Guard:</strong> 17 (Agility 2, Might 2, Splint Mail 3)</li><li><strong>Toughness:</strong> 15</li><li><strong>Resolve:</strong> 12</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> 25’ ___</li><li><strong>Feats:</strong> Boon Focus II (Shapeshift) ___</li><li><p><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Splint Mail (treat as Full Plate), Staff, Shortspear ___ <strong>Favored Actions:</strong></p></li><li><em>Shapechange</em> (invoke <em>shapeshift</em>): Auto-success at PL 5 via <em>boon focus</em></li><li><em>Ensnaring Vines</em> (inflict <em>immobile</em>):<br>Creation vs. Toughness</li><li><em>Wall of Briars</em> (invoke <em>barrier</em>): Creation vs. 16 (PL 3)</li><li><em>Animate Plants</em> (invoke <em>summon creature</em>):<br>Alteration vs. 18 - 20 (PL 4 - 5)</li><li><p><em>Regrowth</em> (invoke <em>regeneration</em>): Alteration vs. 12 - 20<br>(PL 1 - 5)</p></li></ul><div class="pageNumber auto"></div><h4 id="bear-form">Bear Form</h4><hr><ul><li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Might 5 (2d6), Agility 1 (1d4), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Perception 2 (1d6)</li><li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20</li><li><strong>Guard:</strong> 19 (Agility 1, Might 5, Splint Mail 3)</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> 25’</li></ul><h4 id="hawk-form">Hawk Form</h4><hr><ul><li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Might 1 (1d4), Agility 3 (1d8), Fortitude 1 (1d4), Perception 5 (2d6)</li><li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 16</li><li><strong>Guard:</strong> 14 (Agility 3, Might 1)</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’ flying</li></ul><h4 id="shark-form">Shark Form</h4><hr><ul><li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Might 4 (1d10), Agility 2 (1d6), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Perception 3 (1d8)</li><li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20</li><li><strong>Guard:</strong> 19 (Agility 2, Might 4, Splint Mail 3)</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’ swimming</li></ul><p><br></p><div style="margin-top: -40px; margin-right: 600px"><h3 id="engineer">Engineer</h3></div><p>Engineers are infused with the<br>spark of creation, and can<br>comprehend the inner<br>workings of extremely<br>complex systems.

Their prowess in ranged combat is fueled by entropic energy gained from otherworldly powers, either purchased through diabolical pacts or earned through prowess of mind and spirit. Out of combat, Gunslingers are perceptive and intimidating, and they can overawe lesser folk with ease. While many Gunslingers are loners bent solely on achieving their mission, those who step up to the occasion make excellent leaders to pull a ragtag posse together into a cohesive unit.</p><p>When a fight breaks out, Gunslingers keep their distance and use their dual revolvers to rain hell down<br>upon their foes. When damage alone isn’t getting the job done, Gunslingers can aim their shots to hinder enemies in all manner of ways: shooting their weapons out of their hands, knocking the wind out of them, or blowing off a toe. The <em>multi-attack specialist</em> feat allows them to shoot twice<br>as fast as a lesser gunfighter, enabling them to take on large groups of foes single-handedly. Supplementing<br>their markshmanship with dark powers, they invoke<br>banes and boons with Entropy. Favorites include<br>invoking <em>life drain</em> to heal a little bit with every shot<br>and afflicting enemies with the <em>sickened</em> bane to<br>render their attacks nearly useless.

If deception is called for, Hackers can tap into Big Brother’s ever-present communication systems to project holograms or audio transmissions using the <em>phantasm</em> bane.</p><p>When combat breaks out, Hackers tend to avoid the front lines, relying on their drones to do the fighting for them.

In particularly difficult fights, the Yoroi enters a <em>battle trance</em>, gaining even stronger defenses and better attack prowess.</p><p>Although the Ningyozukai make use of the <em>alternate form</em> feat, they do not actually physically transform when switching between sorcerer or Yoroi forms.

They can navigate the harshest of terrains and their keen eyes can pick up a trail that has been cold for days. With a faithful animal companion by their side, the Ranger is never alone on the hunt.</p><h4 id="strategy-12">Strategy</h4><p>Rangers are expert trackers, making use of their <em>fast tracker</em> and <em>master tracker</em> feats to follow quarry effortlessly without slowing down. Their exceptional Perception score also means that the Ranger will be the eyes of the party: locating traps, scouting for enemies, and revealing hidden passages. Their extraordinary ability to climb allows them to access paths that might be unreachable by their allies.</p><p>When combat breaks out, the Ranger typically fights in a coordinated effort with their animal companion. In melee, the wolf will attempt to inflict <em>knockdown</em> upon foes, allowing their master to strike with advantage 1 on prone enemies. When they aren’t striking for direct damage, Rangers are disarming foes or whittling away at them with <em>persistent damage</em>. If the Ranger needs to keep a distance from the enemy, they take to the trees and use their longbow while their wolf companion uses <em>immobile</em> to make the target an easy shot for their master. <strong><em>- <strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 4 (1d10), Fortitude 3 (1d8), Might 2 (1d6), Learning 2 (1d6), Perception 5 (2d6), Will 2 (1d6) - <strong>Hit Points:</strong> 20 - <strong>Guard:</strong> 18 (Agility 4, Might 2, Chainmail 2) - <strong>Toughness:</strong> 15 - <strong>Resolve:</strong> 12 - <strong>Speed:</strong> 30’</em></strong> - <strong>Feats:</strong> Fleet of Foot, Master Tracker, Climbing, Companion I <strong><em>- <strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Longsword, Longbow, Chainmail</em></strong> - <strong>Favored Actions:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Longsword + Dagger</em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1</li><li><em>Wounding Strike</em> (inflict <em>persistent damage</em>):<br>Agility vs. Guard, advantage 2</li><li><em>Artful Parry</em> (inflict <em>disarmed</em>): Agility vs. Guard,<br>advantage 2</li><li><em>Longbow</em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard</li><li><em>Foot Shot</em> (inflict <em>slowed</em>): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1</li></ul><h4 id="wolf-companion">Wolf Companion</h4><hr><ul><li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 4 (1d10), Fortitude 2 (1d6), Might 2 (1d6), Perception 3 (1d8), Will 1 (1d4), Presence 1 (1d4)</li><li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 18</li><li><strong>Guard:</strong> 16 (Agility 4, Might 2), <strong>Toughness:</strong> 13, <strong>Resolve:</strong> 12</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’ ___</li><li><p><strong>Favored Actions:</strong></p></li><li><em>Bite</em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard</li><li><p><em>Takedown</em> (inflict <em>knockdown</em>): Agility vs. Guard</p></li></ul><p><img class="full-page cover-all" src="http://localhost:8888/_full_page/shadowdancer%20-%20ivan%20sevic.jpg"></p><div class="pageNumber auto"></div><h3 id="shade">Shade</h3><p>Shades are highly trained assassins that draw upon unearthly power from the in-between the void of shadows where most mortals dare not travel. One with the darkness, they use their powers to deceive and misdirect, catching their prey off guard. These night hunters are trained to slay from a distance–unseen, unheard, and without a trace.</p><h4 id="strategy-13">Strategy</h4><p>While Shades are trained for the specific task of neutralizing threats, their ability to manipulate shadows provides them with exceptional utility. Out of combat, they make excellent scouts, capable of hiding weapons in the extradimensional void with <em>absorb object</em>. Their ability to pass through the void makes them peerless at infiltration. When <em>teleporting</em>, even a titanium vault or door is no obstacle for a Shade as they step through the void or dematerialize into a cloud of inky entropy and slip beneath a door.</p><p>Shades prefer to remain hidden as much as possible so that when combat ensues they can catch their foes off guard. They fire their silenced sniper rifles from cover, and quickly <em>teleport</em> to a new location before they are discovered. On rare occasions where they are spotted, they use <em>haste</em> to make a fast getaway or blanket an area in <em>darkness</em> and slip away unseen.</p><hr><ul><li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Agility 4 (d10), Perception 3 (1d8), Will 2 (1d6), Entropy 3 (1d8), Movement 5 (2d6)</li><li><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 14</li><li><strong>Guard:</strong> 15 (Agility 4, Trenchcoat 1)</li><li><strong>Toughness:</strong> 12</li><li><strong>Resolve:</strong> 12</li><li><strong>Speed:</strong> 30’ ___</li><li><strong>Feats:</strong> Boon Focus I (Teleport), Lethal Strike I ___</li><li><strong>Notable Equipment:</strong> Sniper Rifle, Submachine Gun, Handgun, Knife, Trench Coat (treat as<br>Leather Armor) ___</li><li><p><strong>Favored Actions:</strong></p></li><li><em>Hidden Shot</em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1 if target is unaware or engaging your ally</li><li><em>Rifle</em> (damaging attack): Agility vs. Guard</li><li><em>Tranquilizer Round</em> (inflict <em>incapacitated</em>):<br>Agility vs. Toughness</li><li><em>Leg Shot</em> (inflict <em>slowed</em>):<br>Agility vs. Guard, advantage 1</li><li><em>Submachine Gun</em> (damaging attack, 10’ cube):<br>Agility vs. Guard</li><li><em>Void Step</em> (invoke <em>teleport</em>):<br>Auto-success at PL 5 via <em>boon focus</em></li><li><em>Veil of Shadows</em> (invoke <em>darkness</em>):<br>Entropy vs. 12 - 16 (PL 1 - 3)</li><li><em>Shadow Dodge</em> (invoke <em>resistance</em>):<br>Movement vs. 16 (PL 3)</li><li><p><em>Extraplanar Pocket</em> (invoke <em>absorb object</em>):<br>Movement vs. 18 (PL 4)</p></li></ul><pre><code></code></pre><h3 id="spellsword">Spellsword</h3><p>Equally skilled with a blade as they are with sorcery, Spellswords weave magic and martial prowess together into a powerful combination.

Although they shine the most in the heat of battle, Spellswords can also make use of Protection and Movement attributes to provide utility to overcome many obstacles.</p><p>Within combat, the Spellsword’s <em>attribute substitution</em> feat allows them to use their Energy score for weapon attacks, and their trio of extraordinary attributes provides them with access to a versatile selection of banes and boons. <em>Lightning reflexes</em> ensures that they will often act early in combat, and Spellswords will use this opportunity to invoke the <em>resistance</em> boon or inflict a vulnerable target with <em>persistent<br>damage</em>.
