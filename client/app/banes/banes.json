If they are about to strike you with a piece of furniture, they will restrain themselves - still angry and hostile, but no longer violent. If they want to help you and are leaning toward trusting you, but have some hesitation because you've just met, then that hesitation goes away.<br /><strong>Major Charm</strong> - The attacker chooses whether the major charm is platonic or romantic. If platonic, the bane causes the target to consider the attacker their best friend and one of the most trustworthy and noble people they have met in all their lives. Alternatively, the attacker can choose for this trust and admiration to manifest as romantic love. The attacker is unable to do anything to plot against the one who afflicted them, and will (at the earliest possible opportunity) tell their charmer of any rumored harm or danger coming their way. The afflicted character becomes immediately suspicious of anyone who speaks ill of their attacker.<br />The target is mentally compelled to like and trust you more, depending on the power level of the bane when invoked.<br />  <ul><br />  <li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - You can Minor Charm creatures of animal level intelligence or lower.</li><br />  <li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - You can Minor Charm, creatures of humanoid intelligence.

When she later transforms back into Agent Walker, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from her new maximum, leaving her with 10 out of 20 hit points.
