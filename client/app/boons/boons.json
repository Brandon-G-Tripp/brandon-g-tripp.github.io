You acquire all the Agility, Fortitude, Might, and Perception attributes of the chosen form.  Initially, shapeshifting targets must be of the same size as the target (you or someone else) and the same power as the character bestowing the boon.  The following limitations apply initially, and are gradually removed at higher power levels:<br /><ul><br /><li>You do not gain alternate forms of movement (flight, swimming, climbing, burrowing)</li><br /><li>The new form cannot be a different size than that of the target</li><br /><li>The target does not gain supernatural attributes of the new form (hence, cannot inflict banes that rely on the creature’s Supernatural attributes)</li><br /></ul><br />When shapeshifting, the qualities omitted above are gained as you grow in power with the ALTERATION attribute.<br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Power Level 3</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature between half and double your size. Gain any non-flight movement modes of the target creature.</li><br /><li><strong>Power Level 4</strong> - Shapeshift into another creature between one quarter and quadruple the target creature's starting size. </li><br /><li><strong>Power Level 5</strong> - Gain the Flying movement mode of the target creature</li><br /><li><strong>Power Level 7</strong> - Shapeshift into an unnatural living creature, that lacks a typical physiology; an elemental, or a plant for example.</li><br /><li><strong>Power Level 8</strong> - Shapeshift into a creature of any size. </li><br /><li><strong>Power Level 9</strong> - Gain all Supernatural attributes possessed by the target. </li></ul><br /><strong>Special</strong>: Shapeshifting into a specific creature (attempting to impersonate them) requires a deception action roll which is opposed by perception attribute of anyone who sees the shapeshifted. In addition, power level 2 and 4 shapeshifting does not give the shapeshifter mastery of the non-native movement modes of the creature they shift into. So, shapeshifting into a form that allows swimming only works for characters that can already swim or are shapeshifted by power level 6 or higher.<br />"
