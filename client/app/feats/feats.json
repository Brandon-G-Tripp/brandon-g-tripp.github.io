    "effect": "This feat allows you to create items that can invoke a given bane or boon either autonomously or by a wielder.<br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - You can create an item with this feat. Choose a target attribute score for the item, equal or less than 2 points below the attribute you use in the creation process (e.g. if you have an attribute score of 5, the maximum score of the item is 3). <br /><br />  Next, choose whether the item is permanent or expendable. A potion or scroll may be an expendable item that triggers the Heal boon, while a ring of invisibility may be a permanent item that triggers the invisibility boon when the wielder concetrates on using it.  <br /><br />  Creating an expendable item requires 1 full 8-hour day of uninterrupted work. Creating a permanent item, requires one such day of work per attribute point. <br /><br />  At the end of this period, make an attribute roll with a prerequisite attribute. If you fail the roll, typically nothing bad happens, but you must begin the cycle again and spend the same amount of time to try again at creating the item. The created item has an attibute score less than or equal to the CR of your roll, no greater than two points less than the attribute you used in the roll to create. So, on a 16 you can create an item with an Attribute score 3 or less, if you have a score of 5 or greater for the prerequisite attribute used in item creation.<br />  <br /><br />  Next, choose a bane or boon of power level less than or equal to the item's attribute score from the previous step. This item is forever linked to that particular bane or boon.<br />  <br /><br />  An expendable item used to invoke a boon automatically succeeds at invocation. An expendable item used to invoke a bane gets Advantage 1 to it's attribute roll.<br /><br />  A permanent item can be invoked once per hour, after which it has to recharge before it can be used again. <br /><br />  The banes and boons available for imbuing depend on the attribute used to create the item, as follows:<br />  <ul><br />  <li><strong>Any Supernatural Attribute</strong> - The item can only be imbued with a bane or boon that is accessible via the attribute used. </li><br />  <li><strong>Learning</strong> - You can imbue an item with only Physical attributes (Might, Agility) and the corresponding banes and boons.</li><br />  <li><strong>Creation</strong> - Being capable of manifesting something from nothing via channeling otherworldly energy, you can imbue the item with any attribute, even if you do not have a score in that attribute.</li><br />  </ul><br /></li><br /><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Following the same rules above, you gain the following additional benefits: <br /><br />  <ul><br />  <li>The target attribute score for the item can now be equal to your attribute score or less. So, with a prerequisite attribute score of 5, you can imbue an item with an attribute score of 5.</li><br />  <li>For expendable items, bane attacks have Advantage 2 instead of Advnatage 1.</li><br />  <li>You can imbue low-level sentience or autonomy into your crafted items. During creation, you work with the GM to define a set of conditions that cause the item to trigger. Some examples include: magically guided fireballs triggered when someone enters a given area, or a teleportation circle that activates when someone steps on a magical trigger. For those imbuing with non-magical means, this \"autonomy\" could be more mundane, for example: pressure plates surrounded by murder holes (arrow slits with self-reloading crossbows).</li><br />  <li>Permanent items you imbue not only possess the imbued attribute score for the purpose of invoking a particular bane or boon, but can make attacks with their attribute score. If the item's attribute is greater than the wielders, then it supersedes the attribute for the wielder. For example - a Flaming Sword imbued in the 9th circle of Hell could have Energy 9, allowing a town guard with Might 3 to make attacks with Energy 9 instead of Might 3.  A non-supernatural example could be ballistae on a large embattlement that are imbued with Agility 4 and can be used to invoke the Forced Move bane.</li><br />  </ul><br /></li><br /><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - You can imbue humanlike sentience into the item, it gains it's own personality, intelligence, this epic feat should be worked out closely with your GM, you should specify a blueprint for what the item's personality, mission, preferences, etc. will be, and the GM should elaborate and add unforeseen quirks or flaws that make sense given the item's purpose.</li><br /></ul><br />"

Note that this doesn’t grant access to banes or boons you could not normally access, it only increases the dice used for the action roll.</li><br />  </ul><br />  </li><br /><strong>Tier 2</strong> - You gain the following abilities:<br /><li><br /><ul><br />  <li>You can heighten a bane or boon invocation with multiple contributing characters with the same Supernatural attribute. Doing so sets a minimum invocation time of 1 hour, heightening the effects of banes or boons that normally have a lesser invocation time per the rules of Tier 1. All participants must already be capable of invoking the bane or boon. When heightening the effects of a bane or boon as outlined in Tier 1, each additional participant heightens the invocation in the same way that a time increment increase would as outlined in the Tier 1 feat description (range, area, or attribute dice).</li><br />  <li>You can increase the invocation time by 1 increment to a minimum of 10 minutes, and cause the bane or boon to persist for 1 minute automatically. In the case of boons, a sustain action is not required, the boon persists automatically and can’t be interrupted by breaking the caster’s concentration (only via Dispelling with Abjuration). In the case of banes, after the initial action roll to invoke the bane, the first resist roll allowed is 1 minute after the bane is invoked (this applies to both voluntary resist rolls and free resist rolls that would normally be part of the bane’s effect)</li><br /></ul><br /></li><br /><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - You gain the ability to permanently bestow or dispel banes and boons. In order to bestow the bane or boon, you must rigorously attend to the ritual process for a number of days equal to the power level of the bane or boon to be invoked or dispelled. During that time you can eat, sleep, and act normally with two exceptions: 1) You must work actively on the ritual and with minimal interruption for 8 hours out of each day. 2) You can leave the area and move about freely during the down time each day, but for the 8 hours of active ritual invocation you must be in the same physical / geographic location where the ritual was initiated. When the invocation time is completed, make an action roll with a DL according to the boon or bane’s Power Level. Bestowing or Dispelling a bane or boon is detailed below:<br />    <ul><br />    <li><strong>Bestow Boon</strong> - You cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent boon to permanently affect the target. The target can thereafter invoke the boon at will, without requiring an action roll to do so. The target does not need to use a Sustain action to persist the effect, and the effect can only be dispelled either temporarily with the Dispel bane, or permanently with the Ritual feat (see the Remove Boon entry that follows).  The boon must be invoked using an attribute that could normally be used to invoke it.</li><br />    <li><strong>Bestow Bane</strong> - You cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent  bane to permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and does not allow Resist rolls to end it’s effects. The effect can be dispelled either temporarily with the Dispel bane, or permanently with the Ritual feat (see the Remove Bane entry that follows). The bane must be invoked using an attribute that could normally be used to invoke it. </li><br />    <li><strong>Dispel Boon</strong> - You cause a permanent boon (as described in the previous entry) to be forever stripped from the target, causing it to lose the ability to invoke the bane automatically.  This dispelling can be done only with an Entropy action roll.</li><br />    <li><strong>Dispel Bane</strong> - You break the curse of a permanent bane (as described in the previous entry) afflicting the target, the bane can still be invoked by other means.  This dispelling can be done only with an Abjuration action roll.</li><br />    </ul><br />  </li><br /></ul><br />"
