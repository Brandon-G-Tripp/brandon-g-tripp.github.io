Choose a target attribute score for the item, less than or equal to 2 points below the attribute you use in the creation process (e.g. if you have an attribute score of 5, the maximum score of the item is 3). <br /><br />  Next, choose whether the item is permanent or expendable. A potion or scroll may be an expendable item that triggers the heal boon, for example, while a ring of invisibility may be a permanent item that triggers the invisibility boon when the wielder concetrates on using it.  <br /><br />  Creating an expendable item requires 1 full 8-hour day of uninterrupted work. Creating a permanent item, requires one such day of work per attribute score of the item. <br /><br />  At the end of this period, make an attribute roll with a prerequisite attribute. The CR of this roll equals 10 plus twice the attribute score of the item.<br />  <br /><br />  Next, choose a bane or boon of power level less than or equal to the item's attribute score from the previous step. This item is forever linked to that particular bane or boon.<br />  <br /><br />  An expendable item used to invoke a boon automatically succeeds at invocation. An expendable item used to invoke a bane grants advantage 1 to the attribute roll to invoke.<br /><br />  A permanent item can be invoked once per hour, after which it has to recharge before it can be used again. <br /><br />  The banes and boons available for imbuing depend on the attribute used to create the item, as follows:<br />  <ul><br />  <li><strong>Any Supernatural Attribute</strong> - The item can only be imbued with a bane or boon that is accessible to the creator via the attribute used. </li><br />  <li><strong>Learning</strong> - You can imbue an item with only Physical attributes (Might, Agility, Fortitude) and the corresponding banes and boons.</li><br />  <li><strong>Creation</strong> - Being capable of manifesting something from nothing via channeling otherworldly energy, you can imbue the item with any attribute, even if you do not have a score in that attribute.</li><br />  </ul><br /></li><br /><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Following the same rules above, you gain the following additional benefits: <br /><br />  <ul><br />  <li>The target attribute score for the item can now be equal to your attribute score or less. So, with a prerequisite attribute score of 5, you can imbue an item with an attribute score of 5.</li><br />  <li>For expendable items, bane attacks have advantage 2 instead of advantage 1.</li><br />  <li>You can imbue low-level sentience or autonomy into your crafted items. During creation, you work with the GM to define a set of conditions that cause the item to trigger. Some examples include magically guided fireballs triggered when someone enters a given area or a teleportation circle that activates when someone steps on a magical trigger. For those imbuing with non-magical means, this autonomy could be more mundane, for example: pressure plates surrounded by murder holes (arrow slits with self-reloading crossbows).</li><br />  <li>Permanent items you imbue not only possess the imbued attribute score for the purpose of invoking a particular bane or boon, but can make attacks with their attribute score. If the item's attribute is greater than the wielder's, then it supersedes the attribute for the wielder. For example - a Flaming Sword imbued in the 9th circle of Hell could have Energy 9, allowing a town guard with Might 3 to make attacks with Energy 9 instead of Might 3.  A non-supernatural example could be ballistae on a large embattlement that are imbued with Agility 4 and can be used to invoke the Forced Move bane.</li><br />  </ul><br /></li><br /><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - You can imbue humanlike sentience into the item, it gains its own personality and intelligence. This epic feat should be worked out closely with your GM to specify a blueprint for what the item's personality, mission, preferences, and similar values will be, and the GM should elaborate and add unforeseen quirks or flaws that make sense given the item's purpose.</li><br /></ul><br />"

At the conclusion of the ritual, each contributor may choose one of the effects granted by Tier 1 of this feat.</li><br />  <li>You gain the following additional option to choose from when empowering your invocations with ritual magic:</li><br />    <ul><br />    <li>Cause a boon to persist for 1 minute automatically without need to use a sustain action.

If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent boon to permanently affect the target. The target can thereafter invoke the boon at will, without requiring an action roll to do so. The target does not need to use a sustain action to persist the effect, and the effect can only be dispelled either temporarily with the Dispel bane, or permanently with the Ritual Magic feat (see the Remove Boon entry that follows).</li><br /><li><strong>Bestow Bane</strong> - Make an action roll to invoke the bane as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent bane to permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and does not allow resist rolls to end its effects. The effect can be dispelled either temporarily with the Dispel bane, or permanently with the Ritual Magic feat (see the Remove Bane entry that follows).</li><br /><li><strong>Dispel Boon</strong> - Make an Entropy roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the boon you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you cause a permanent boon to be forever stripped from the target, causing them to lose the ability to invoke the bane automatically.</li><br /><li><strong>Dispel Bane</strong> - Make an Abjuration roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the bane you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you break the curse of a permanent bane afflicting the target, though the bane can still be invoked by other means.</li><br /></ul><br />"
