    "effect": "Upon taking this feat, you build a single alternate form using the normal character creation rules, though your attribute and feat points are determined by your tier in this feat:<br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - Half of your primary form's attribute points (rounded up), and 3 feat points.</li><br /><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Same attribute points as your primary form, and 3 feat points per level.</li><br /></ul><br />Whenever your primary form gains new attribute points or levels up, your alternate form also gains points according to the above formulas.<br />As a focus action, you may change between any two forms (including your primary form or any alternate form). You maintain this capability in all of your forms.<br />Each form is treated as a completely different character for mechanical purposes - possessing different attributes, feats, perks, flaws, and other defining characteristics. Your alternate form does, however, retain the ability to transform back into your primary form.<br />In order to keep track of hit points, you should always record the total damage that your character has suffered. When transforming, your damage remains with you even if your maximum hit points change. For example, Dr. Jekyll has a max HP of 15 and Mr. Hyde has a max HP of 30. During combat, Mr. Hyde suffers 10 damage. When he later transforms back into Dr. Jekyll, the 10 damage remains and is subtracted from his new maximum, leaving the doctor with 5 out of 15 hit points. Additionally, when changing forms, if your hit points would be reduced to less than 1, your hit point total becomes 1 instead.<br />",

The link must be logical and consistent with the story you are trying to tell. For example, a bard who subsitutes her Presence for her Might to represent her dance-based melee fighting style would likely not get to use her Presence Score for determining her carrying capacity. Furthermore, the GM should prevent players from creating illogical substitutions that are purely aimed at making their characters unreasonably powerful. Two examples of proper uses of this feat include an calculating warrior who studies angles, leverage, and physics to substitute Logic for Might, or a gunslinger who channels dark energy, giving her deadshot accuracy and substituting Entropy for Agility.<br />"

    "effect": "Provided you have the appropriate working space and materials (as determined by the GM), you can create extraordinary items. You can only imbue an item with attributes, banes, and boons that you can access. For example, in order to create a sword with Energy 5, you must possess an Energy score of 5 or higher. The only exception to this is if you possess the Creation, Learning, or Logic attributes. These allow you to imbue items with any attribute, bane, or boon as long as their value is less than or equal to your attribute score. The GM may rule that certain uses of Creation, Learning, or Logic are unreasonable when it comes to crafting extraordinary items.<br />Your tier in this feat determines the maximum Wealth Level of the items you can create, based on the attribute you are using to craft:<br /><ul><li><strong>Tier 1</strong> - Maximum Wealth Level equals Attribute minus 2</li><li><strong>Tier 2</strong> - Maximum Wealth Level equals Attribute minus 1</li><li><strong>Tier 3</strong> - Maximum Wealth Level equals Attribute</li></ul><br />For example, a character with Creation 5 and tier 1 in this feat could create items up to Wealth Level 3.<br />You can determine the Wealth Level of the item you want to create by consulting the sample items in <strong>Chapter 8: Rewards</strong> or by developing a custom item using the rules for <strong>Building Your Own Extraordinary Items</strong> in that chapter.<br />Creating an item with the <em>consumable</em> property requires one full 8-hour day of uninterrupted work. Other items require a duration of uninterrupted work based on their Wealth Level, as follows:<br /><ul><li><strong>Wealth Level 1 - 3</strong>: Two days per Wealth Level</li><li><strong>Wealth Level 4 - 5</strong>: Four days per Wealth Level</li><li><strong>Wealth Level 6 - 7</strong>: One week per Wealth Level</li><li><strong>Wealth Level 8 - 9</strong>: One month per Wealth Level</li></ul><br />At the end of this time, your item is created. Crafting an item still counts as an expenditure of wealth, so you must have a sufficient Wealth Score to purchase the item, following all the rules for spending wealth provided in <strong>Chapter 8: Rewards</strong>. The GM may waive some or all of the costs associated with an item if you possess special materials for the crafting of your item. For example, if you have recently collected the hide of a slain red dragon and decide to make a suit of Armor of Resistance (Fire), the GM may decide that the dragon’s hide is enough to make up most of the costs of the armor, so the armor’s wealth level is reduced by 3 for purposes of determining crafting costs.<br />"

At the conclusion of the ritual, each contributor may choose one of the effects granted by Tier 1 of this feat.</li><br />  <li>You gain the following additional option to choose from when empowering your invocations with ritual magic:</li><br />    <ul><br />    <li>Cause a boon to persist for 1 minute automatically without needing to use a sustain action. Furthermore, enemies cannot end the boon through use of a disrupting attack (though the Nullify bane still works).</li><br />    <li>Targets may not make resist rolls against a bane for one minute after it is invoked.</li><br />    </ul><br /></ul><br /><br /><strong>Tier 3</strong> - You gain the ability to permanently bestow or dispel banes and boons. In order to bestow the bane or boon, you must rigorously attend to the ritual process for a number of days equal to the power level of the bane or boon to be invoked or nullified. During that time you can eat, sleep, and act normally with two exceptions: 1) You must work actively on the ritual and with minimal interruption for 8 hours out of each day. 2) You can leave the area and move about freely during the down time each day, but for the 8 hours of active ritual invocation you must be in the same physical or geographic location where the ritual was initiated. When the invocation time is completed, make an action roll as follows:<br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Bestow Boon</strong> - Make an action roll to invoke the boon as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent boon to permanently affect the target. The target can thereafter invoke the boon at will, without requiring an action roll to do so. The target does not need to use a sustain action to persist the effect, and the effect can only be nullified either temporarily with the Nullify bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Boon entry that follows).</li><br /><li><strong>Bestow Bane</strong> - Make an action roll to invoke the bane as usual. If successful, you cause a non-instantaneous & non-permanent bane to permanently affect the target. The bane persists indefinitely and does not allow resist rolls to end its effects. The effect can be nullified either temporarily with the Dispel bane, or permanently with the Heightened Invocation feat (see the Dispel Bane entry that follows).</li><br /><li><strong>Dispel Boon</strong> - Make an Entropy roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the boon you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you cause a permanent boon to be forever stripped from the target, causing them to lose the ability to invoke the bane automatically.</li><br /><li><strong>Dispel Bane</strong> - Make a Protection roll with a Challenge Rating equal to 10 + twice the power level of the bane you are attempting to dispel. If successful, you break the curse of a permanent bane afflicting the target, though your target gains no special immunity to it.</li><br /></ul><br />"

Thus, the limit is 2 additional attacks at 1st level, 3 additional attacks at 3rd level, and 6 additional attacks at 9th level.<br /><strong>Example</strong> - Vax the Deathbringer has Multi Attack Specialist (Tier III). He declares that he will be making three attacks this round (two additional attacks). Therefore, all of his attacks suffer disadvantage 3 (3 x 2 = 6, minus 3 for feat tier 3). His first attack is a necromantic burst targeting a 10'-square. Because of the area of effect, Vax suffers an additional disadvantage 2, making his total disadvantage for that attack 5. For his second attack, Vax casts a spell of blindness on a single foe, making an action roll at disadvantage 3. For his final attack, Vax moves in to melee and uses his touch of death on three foes. Targeting 3 foes incurs an additional disadvantage 3, making his final attack roll suffer a total of disadvantage 6.<br />"
