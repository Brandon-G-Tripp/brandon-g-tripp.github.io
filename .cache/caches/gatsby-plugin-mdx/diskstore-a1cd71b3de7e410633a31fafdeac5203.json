You do not need to sustain a boon on the round in which it is invoked as long as you are not sustaining any other boons.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Description.`}</strong>{` This entry simply provides a general idea of what the boon could look like in the story.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Effect.`}</strong>{` This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the boon on the rules of the game.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
