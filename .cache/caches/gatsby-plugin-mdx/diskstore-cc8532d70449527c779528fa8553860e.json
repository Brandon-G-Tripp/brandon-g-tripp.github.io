As in the vignettes above, every game of Open Legend revolves around intrepid characters performing heroic deeds. They will fight mythic beasts, outsmart cunning foes, break ancient curses, crack baffling cases, discover untold treasures, and more.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you have never played a roleplaying game before, you can think of it as a movie in which the actors make up the script (and even much of the plot) as the movie is being shot. One player, called the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Game Master`}</strong>{` (or GM), acts as producer, director, and writer. The GM establishes the setting, creates the antagonists, and develops enough plot to get the other players started. The GM also acts out the part of the villains and neutral characters in the story.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The rest of the players take the role of `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Player Characters`}</strong>{` (or PCs). The PCs are the protagonists of the story. In a high fantasy setting, one PC might be a dwarven warrior with a lust for gems, another an immortal elven wizard whose only desire is knowledge, and still another a half-angelic priest who travels the world in order to inspire others to act justly. In another game of Open Legend, the players might star as a rag tag crew of space pirates living from score to score on their barely functioning merchant class starship. All the common tropes could make an appearance: the reckless pilot, the brash captain with a troubled past, the hired gun, the stowaway, and the engineer who gets along with the ship better than with the crew.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Whatever the motivation of their characters, the players share a common goal: to take the plot and setting established by the GM and have fun. At some tables, this might look like J.R.R Tolkien's `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Lord of the Rings`}</em>{`. In others, it might look more like `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Monty Python and the Holy Grail`}</em>{`. Whatever fun looks like at your table, Open Legend will be a part of it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is your story.

The rules should be robust, but their only value is in telling a story.`}</p>\n    <p>{`For example, Open Legend's streamlined systems for secondary effects (banes) and multi-target attacks mean that all characters use the same mechanics to craft unique attacks. In a fantasy campaign, an elemental mage might blast a fork of lightning to damage and stun his foes. A star trooper in a far future campaign might shoot an energy beam to create the very same effect. The rules for both attacks are the same regardless of the story you are using the mechanics to tell.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As storytellers, we love intricate plotlines that feature characters of depth and beauty.
