Other GMs start with a list of NPCs or factions, thinking through their motivations and personalities. Creating this cast of characters allows them to imagine a host of conflicts and conspiracies that will naturally transform into dramatic encounters once the PCs are thrown into the mix.

for granting experience levels. For example, the table shows that by 4th level, a typical character should have progressed to wealth score 4. Using the experience level milestone plan detailed previously, we could decide that after stopping the first threat to Woodshold, the people of the town take up a collection to reward the heroes. We can also plan to give the Cult of the Dragon a horde of treasure that will again increase the party's wealth score.`}</p>\n    <p>{`However you plan to award wealth, you can see that the general recommendation on the table is for a PC's wealth score to increase twice every three levels.`}</p>\n    <h4 {...{\n      \"id\": \"understanding-open-legends-wealth-system\"\n    }}>{`Understanding Open Legend's Wealth System`}</h4>\n    <p>{`If you or your players have a background with other game systems, in which they may have regularly looted every corpse, scavenged every piece of equipment, and dutifully tracked every single gold piece, then Open Legend's wealth system might initially feel a bit awkward. If it does, consider some of the following tips:`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`NPCs still have stuff on them.`}</strong>{` Just because you don't need to spend hours tracking every piece of loot that the players cut from a corpse doesn't mean that those corpses don't have stuff on them. Their loot just fades into the background so that you can focus on the story. Think of any movie or novel. How often does the action focus on the characters picking at the defeated bodies of the antagonists? Rarely. And, if they do take something from a foe, it's usually to serve the plot.`}</p>\n    <p>{`So, when a combat encounter ends, instead of listing off how many crossbow bolts each bandit has on them, just tell the party that they find a few valuables to add to their ever-growing stash, but that it's still not enough to increase their wealth score. If a player does legitimately need another clip of ammo or another dagger or a new cloak, then you can decide whether or not it makes sense for the NPCs to have them.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Wealth represents influence.`}</strong>{` Since players aren't tracking individual gold pieces, dollars, or gems, situations like bribery might initially prove to be a bit sticky.

But it's best not to go alone, and often the characters will find help along the way. Collectively these friends and foes are called “NPCs” (non-player characters). When planning out a campaign or adventure, consider that the NPCs of your story typically fall into one of the following categories:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Henchmen`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Villains`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Allies`}</p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"henchmen\"\n    }}>{`Henchmen`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Henchman is a general term to describe any antagonist who simply exists as a small obstacle to the party's short term plans. Examples of henchmen include a wandering band of space pirates that waylays the party mid-flight, a mindless ooze roaming the deep corners of a cavernous dungeon, and a team of assassins dispatched by the local mob boss to put an end to the heroes' meddling. While henchmen typically have realistic motives, their influence on the plot is small enough that you don't need to spend as much energy to make your henchmen deep and convincing. The pirates are motivated by greed, the ooze by hunger, and the assassins by loyalty to their guild.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"villains\"\n    }}>{`Villains`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The villain of a plotline is the primary antagonist, and your players will likely deal with multiple villains throughout their careers. Examples include necromancer who has taken up residence in the local graveyard, the distributed AI consciousness that controls the galactic senate's every decision, and the bandit king who has united the ruffians of the realm under one banner. Unlike henchmen, your villains will require a good amount of thought to flesh out. To develop strong, convincing villains, consider the following elements.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Motive.`}</strong>{` Every villain should have a realistic motive, or a reason for turning towards their villainous ways. Instead of deciding that your necromancer is simply evil, for example, consider making him fallen. Perhaps he turned to necromancy as a last resort to revive his beloved who was killed in a shipwreck.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Scheme.`}</strong>{` Your villain's scheme is the evil deed they have set out to complete. The scheme is often tied directly to the motive. For example, rather than the necromancer simply being set on snuffing the life out of the town, his scheme involves sacrificing ten villagers as part of a ritual to return his beloved to life.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Flaw.`}</strong>{` A flaw is part of what makes a villain human (even if the villain is an ancient wyrm). A flaw could be a physical vulnerability, such as the bare patch of the dragon Smaug's left breast, or it could be a social, mental, or emotional insufficiency. Our necromancer, for example, could be easily set into a blind rage against anyone who speaks ill of his beloved.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"allies\"\n    }}>{`Allies`}</h3>\n    <p>{`NPCs aren't limited to antagonists, of course. Many of the most important characters to your plotline will be allies of the heroes. Perhaps the party is guided by a wizened sage who secludes himself in a high tower and for unknown reasons allows only the PCs access to his wisdom. Another example includes a team of native elves who have been dispatched to see the heroes safely through a haunted wood.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Whatever sorts of allies the party has acquired, it's important for the GM to abide by a few guidelines to ensure that the allies add to the fun rather than detract from it.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Allies should empower the heroes, not outshine them.`}</strong>{` Effective allies provide the players with the power or opportunity to achieve even greater deeds. To put it another way, the allies should help the party shine rather than take the spotlight for themselves. Players want to be the main characters of their story, so it's important to avoid the temptation to make your NPCs the center of attention. Although these tactics might work in some situations, you should generally shy away from the following:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Allowing an NPC to sweep in and save the day.`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Having an NPC be the primary damage dealer in a fight.`}</p>\n      </li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">\n        <p parentName=\"li\">{`Creating situations in which the players feel forced to take an NPC's orders or advice.`}</p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`If you find the NPCs in your game frequently taking these or similar roles, then there's a good chance your players might become frustrated.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Sometimes it can add to the story to have an ally contribute in a way that the players can't, but it's important to find some purpose for the players to fulfill that the NPC can't for one reason or another. For example, a villainous mad scientist uses a poisonous gas to control the minds of a group of soldiers and commands them to attack the players. A powerful ally NPC might use her medical knowledge to create an anti-toxin to protect the minds of the players by breaking the influence over them and half of the soldiers. However, the NPC isn't capable of providing this protection for all of the soldiers - the players must then complete the vital task of subduing (ideally without killing) the dominated soldiers and preventing them from harming anyone.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The above example will likely be an intriguing scene enjoyed by all, because the ally NPC can't prevail without the help of the players.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Allies can be used to grant knowledge.`}</strong>{` In addition to providing players with new power, allies can also be the purveyors of information. A savvy merchant knows how to gain leverage on the members of the trader's guild; a pitiful sanitation clerk turned wererat possesses the only known map of the city sewers; a sage who acts as patron to the party has discovered the location of the Universe Portal. By using allies to inform the players of secret or hidden knowledge, you put the power of what to do with that information in the PCs' hands.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Allies should be imperfect.`}</strong>{` The best allies are the ones who are flawed just like the PCs. They have physical weaknesses that can be taken advantage of, moral faults that can be exploited, or needs that they can't fulfill on their own. If the allies are so powerful that no mortal can stop them and they want for nothing, the players are likely to wonder why the NPC is giving them the time of day in the first place, and, by finding ways to demonstrate your NPCs' imperfections, you'll further immerse your players in the campaign world.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"npc-statistics\"\n    }}>{`NPC Statistics`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Many of the NPCs that the PCs encounter throughout their journey will be used solely for the purposes of role playing or setting the mood. These sort of background characters typically don't need a full array of attributes, feats, and favored attacks because, more likely than not, you'll never make a single action roll for them. Angus the Blacksmith, for example, might spice up the town bazaar a bit with his Scottish accent and epic tales of fraudulent accomplishments—but your party is never going to need to engage him in combat.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A good deal of your NPCs, however, will require statistical descriptions to use for combat or social encounters. This section will describe two ways that you can build these statistics: the complex build and the simple build.`}</p>\n    <h4 {...{\n      \"id\": \"complex-build\"\n    }}>{`Complex Build`}</h4>\n    <p>{`When designing an NPC using the complex build, you simply create the NPC as if it was a player character. Select an appropriate level and use the instructions in Chapter 1 to assign attributes, feats, and other defining characteristics.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The complex build is a good option when you are creating a very important villain or ally who will play a major role in the story line. This process can take a while, so it's not worth going through with underlings, henchmen, or beasts who are only going to be present for a single scene.`}</p>\n    <h4 {...{\n      \"id\": \"simple-build\"\n    }}>{`Simple Build`}</h4>\n    <p>{`The simple build option is useful when you need to come up with statistics on the fly. For example, imagine the party fails an action roll to move stealthily through a swamp to avoid the local denizens. You decide that they have attracted the attention of a handful of poisonous serpents that lair in the swamp, but you don't have any stats written up for these enemies. In this situation, you could use the simple build rules to get combat rolling quickly.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Use the NPC Simple Build Table to determine the NPCs's most relevant statistics. For the hit point and defense columns, choose values within the given ranges based on the strengths and weaknesses of the NPC enemy you are building. Choose 1 to 3 primary attributes that will form the main basis of the NPC's attacks and actions, and then choose as many secondary attributes as you need in order to define the NPCs's other capabilities. These form a rough guideline that we recommend you not exceed, though you can feel free to assign lower attributes and even higher ones if you feel that's appropriate.

When determining how a fight ends, remember to consider the motivations of the combatants and the demands of the plot. Are the PCs worth more to the orc chief alive than dead? Will the story be more interesting if the dragon doesn't wipe out the entire party? Consider some of the following possibilities whenever deciding how a fight will end.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Don't be afraid to end it early.`}</strong>{` Sometimes, despite all your plans, a combat just takes too long. Or maybe the party's luck runs dry and they spend four rounds trying to kill the last two carnivorous shrubs. It's okay to fast-forward the combat when things are going stale and everyone at the table is ready for the next scene. Simply narrate the gist of what happens, and move on. Generally, you should only do this if the combat is obviously going to end in the PCs' favor. If the bad guys are winning, most parties will likely want to fight to the bitter end. If you are fast-forwarding to a party defeat, be sure that ALL of your players are agreeable first.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Partial defeat is more interesting than a total party kill.`}</strong>{` Battles are much greater swirling maelstroms of chaos than our gridded battle mats, top-down views, and sequential turns would lead us to believe. This means that the GM has plenty of wiggle room for creating outcomes that might not have come up in the blow-by-blow narrative of the encounter. So, if the entire party is knocked unconscious or otherwise defeated, you are well within your rights to say that, for example, one of the PCs stumbled out of sight unnoticed before passing out, or that the monsters leave half of the party for dead and capture the few that they think are still alive. Little twists like this allow the players a chance to turn a loss into an epic tale for revenge or recovery.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Hard decisions test a hero's mettle.`}</strong>{` A favorite tactic of super villains everywhere is to force the hero to decide between winning the fight or saving a mass of helpless bystanders. Combat encounters in Open Legend can also end in tough decisions for the party: the sorceress hovers over a magma filled chasm so that landing the final blow also means destroying the magical staff she wields, the hill giant reveals that he has an innocent family captive in a cave which he will only reveal if his life is spared, and so on. Though your players will get tired of these tactics if they are used excessively, forcing hard choices on your heroes will help them define their characters and prove their loyalties.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Death is okay, sometimes.`}</strong>{` The above suggestions aren't meant to imply that you should never kill off a PC (or four). They are simply illustrations of the variety of ways that a fight can end in an interesting manner. Sometimes, heroes die, and if your players know that character death is a real possibility, it will make their victories and exploits all the more legendary. If a character does need to die, though, make sure they go out with a bang, with an epic story to be sung by bards for ages eternal.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"on-balance-and-fairness\"\n    }}>{`On Balance and Fairness`}</h3>\n    <p>{`When planning your encounters, you do not need to strive for balance, but you should aim to be fair to your players.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Video games are balanced: they are designed to present players with incremental challenges that grow in difficulty alongside the power of the player.

But you do have to be fair about it. You are responsible for warning the party to the danger that lies ahead. It would be unfair, for example, to drop an ancient red wyrm upon an unsuspecting party of first level PCs with no option to escape.
