For example, if your party spends several months on board a ship, the GM may reward everyone with the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`profession: sailor`}</em>{` perk. Likewise, if you are subjected to horrible chemical burns as part of a laboratory explosion, the GM might assign you the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`physical deformity`}</em>{` flaw to describe your scarred face.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You too, may decide to adopt new perks or flaws with the GM's approval as your character's personality and background develop through play. Perhaps a series of encounters with powerful forces leads you to take on the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`cowardly`}</em>{` flaw. Or maybe you spend significant downtime between adventures training with the local weaponsmith and would like to gain the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`artisan`}</em>{` perk. The GM is the final arbiter for deciding when and under what circumstances you may choose new perks and flaws, but you should communicate with them your hopes for your character's development.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"designing-your-own-perks-and-flaws\"\n    }}>{`Designing Your Own Perks and Flaws`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The lists provided in this chapter are by no means comprehensive, and you are encouraged to work with your GM to create the perks and flaws that you need to define your character.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Flaws are very easy to create, as they simply represent situational triggers that hold your character back. Because the PCs decides when their flaws take effect, there is no need to consider balance when creating new flaws.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Perks, on the other hand, often grant elaborate benefits and even mechanical bonuses. These require you to work closely with your GM to ensure that your perks are balanced with the other perks available to PCs. The first rule to adhere to is that perks should provide non-combat effects, as feats, banes, and boons are the primary means for PCs to boost their combat expertise. Next, try to make your proposed perk limited to a specific type of task or a relatively rare situation. For example, the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`artisan`}</em>{` perk provides expertise for a single craft, and the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`attractive`}</em>{` perk is only beneficial in social situations that rely on physical attractiveness. If your perk is more generally applicable, then the effect should be more limited than other perks. For example, the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`idol`}</em>{` perk makes you trusted by just about anyone, but it is limited to being used once per game session.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"activating-perks\"\n    }}>{`Activating Perks`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Perks provide very specific bonuses or effects in specific situations. Your perk description will explain exactly what your perk does and how often it can be activated. Some perks can be used whenever the situation merits while others are more limited. If the use of a perk relies on a situation being relevant to the sphere of influence of the perk, the GM has the final say as to whether the perk applies or not. For example, the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`profession`}</em>{` perk provides advantage 1 to any non-combat action rolls related to your chosen profession. If a character wants to use their `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`profession: hunter`}</em>{` perk to gain advantage on a roll to track an orc, the GM would decide whether or not the PC's experience tracking game was relevant enough to aid in the hunt for a humanoid.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"activating-flaws\"\n    }}>{`Activating Flaws`}</h2>\n    <p>{`While perks provide specific benefits according to their descriptions, flaws are actively used by players to hinder the actions of their characters. You would do this for two primary reasons: first, to add depth and variety to your character and the story; and, second, to earn legend points, which can be used to enhance your chances of success on a future action (see Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes). In this way, flaws and legend points provide a sort of karmic balance to one another. Your sacrifice in one situation is rewarded in a future situation.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To activate a flaw, you should intentionally make a disadvantageous choice based on your flaw that creates an interesting or tense moment in the plot. When you do so, let your GM know that you are activating your flaw and describe how it is hindering your efforts or influencing your decisions. If the GM approves that your flaw is creating a significant disadvantage and advancing the story, you receive one legend point. Sometimes, the GM may recognize that you are roleplaying a flaw without you having to overtly activate it. In such cases, the GM may award you with a legend point as well.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You may not gain a legend point from the same flaw more than once per game session. Furthermore, you are in complete control of how and when your own flaws affect you. For example, you might play a blind samurai (using the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`disabled`}</em>{` flaw) who has such heightened senses of hearing, smell, and touch that they're usually completely unaffected by their blindness. Only under extreme circumstances does the blindness hinder them.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The type of hindrance caused by activating a flaw should be more than a simple reduced chance of success. Good examples of activating a flaw include putting yourself or an ally in danger, making a bad decision, wasting a resource, and missing out on an opportunity, among others. It's also important to note that a good use of a flaw makes something new and interesting happen in the story rather than ending the narrative. For example, instead of activating a flaw to miss an attack, you might target an ally. Or, rather than activating a flaw to fail to find a secret door, you might make so much noise in your search that you attract unwanted attention.`}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <h3 parentName=\"blockquote\" {...{\n        \"id\": \"examples-of-activating-flaws\"\n      }}>{`Examples of Activating Flaws`}</h3>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`Oxnar the Barbarian was never known for his brains, so when the pixie promised him that eating the golden mushroom would make him as strong as a hundred mules, he gobbled it up with no questions and much gusto.

Some examples of disabilities include blindness, deafness, missing limbs, partial paralysis, bone deficiencies, or allergies.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"greedy\"\n    }}>{`Greedy`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You can't help it: you just like `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`things`}</em>{`. Money, gems, items of power - they beckon you at every turn and you'll often take great risks and maybe even betray your allies if the monetary reward is great enough. You're easy to bribe, and you will often push the limits of negotiation or bartering in order to increase your share in the profits, even if it makes you a few enemies.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"honest\"\n    }}>{`Honest`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You won't tell a lie or engage in deceitful speech, even to save your own life or the life of another.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"hot-tempered\"\n    }}>{`Hot Tempered`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Your fuse is short and your explosions are destructive.

But when you do fly off the handle, things rarely go well for you.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"illiterate\"\n    }}>{`Illiterate`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You can't read or write, even in languages that you speak fluently.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"literal-minded\"\n    }}>{`Literal Minded`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You struggle with concepts and turns of phrase that are not literally true, such as idioms and metaphors. You might think sorcery is afoot if someone tells you it is “raining cats and dogs”. If a friend exaggerates by saying “I'd kill myself if Melzak were elected Supreme Justice”, you would be genuinely concerned for your friend's life if Melzak did get elected.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"mood-disorder\"\n    }}>{`Mood Disorder`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You suffer from a psychological condition that directly affects your mood, such as depression or anxiety.

You get to define the scope of your naivety. For example, maybe you're a greenhorn from a big city on the east coast, so you are unlearned in the ways of the Wild West. Or maybe your memory was completely wiped out a few weeks ago and you are relearning the rules of civilization, thus your naivety presents itself much more universally.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"overt\"\n    }}>{`Overt`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You have a strong aversion to subterfuge, legerdemain, and smooth talking. After all, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, so why not follow the straight and narrow path? Your overtness may lead to you mistakenly foil the plans of allies, such as by blurting out a sensitive truth in the midst of a tense negotiation.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"overweight\"\n    }}>{`Overweight`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You are carrying a few extra pounds, and they tend to get in the way at all the wrong times, such as when climbing a ladder or crossing a decrepit rope bridge.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"pacifist\"\n    }}>{`Pacifist`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You disdain combat and bloodshed of any kind, and will generally do whatever possible to avoid it. You can decide the extent of your pacifism. You might just revert to violence as a last resort, or you may be so averse to combat that you won't lift a weapon even in defense of yourself or others.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"phobia\"\n    }}>{`Phobia`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You are terrified and incapable of rational thought when you are presented with the object of your fear. It could be spiders, snakes, closed spaces, crowds, or something less common like co-dependence: a fear of being alone that causes you to always seek out companionship, even if that companionship has a negative impact on your life overall.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"proud\"\n    }}>{`Proud`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Some call it an inflated ego. Others call it conceit. But you know that you really are just that good. The rabble are inferior, and you're not afraid to let them know. Your pride may be a universal sense of self-worth, or it may only manifest itself within certain spheres or situations. For example, your rank in the Royal Star Force leads you to look down upon anyone trained in less illustrious armed forces.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"psychotic\"\n    }}>{`Psychotic`}</h3>\n    <p>{`You are severely mentally deranged to the extent that you occasionally lose touch with reality.

Perhaps you don't respect the personal space of others, tend to ramble in conversation, or share overly personal details.
